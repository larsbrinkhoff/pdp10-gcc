/* You might wonder why we use syscall(SYS_sigaction) in INIT_FPE
 * instead of the standard sigaction().  This is necessary because of
 * the shenanigans above where we increment the PC saved in the
 * context and then return.  This trick will only work when we are
 * called _directly_ by the kernel, because linuxthreads wraps signal
 * handlers and its wrappers do not copy the sigcontext struct back
 * when returning from a signal handler.  If we return from our divide
 * handler to a linuxthreads wrapper, we will lose the PC adjustment
 * we made and return to the faulting instruction again.  Using
 * syscall(SYS_sigaction) causes our handler to be called directly
 * by the kernel, bypassing any wrappers.

 * Also, there is at the present time no unwind info in the
 * linuxthreads library's signal handlers and so we can't unwind
 * through them anyway.  

 * Finally, the code that glibc uses to return from a signal handler
 * is subject to change.  */
