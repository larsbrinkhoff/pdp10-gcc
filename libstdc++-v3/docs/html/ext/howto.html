<h1 class="centered"><a name="top">Extensions</a></h1>

<p>Here we will make an attempt at describing the non-Standard extensions to
   the library.  Some of these are from SGI's STL, some of these are GNU's,
   and some just seemed to appear on the doorstep.
</p>
<p><strong>Before you leap in and use these</strong>, be aware of two things:
   <ol>
    <li>Non-Standard means exactly that.  The behavior, and the very
        existence, of these extensions may change with little or no
        warning.  (Ideally, the really good ones will appear in the next
        revision of C++.)  Also, other platforms, other compilers, other
        versions of g++ or libstdc++-v3 may not recognize these names, or
        treat them differently, or...
    <li>You should know how to <a href="../faq/index.html#5_4">access
        these headers properly</a>.
   </ol>

<h2><a name="1">Ropes and trees and hashes, oh my!</a></h2>
   <p>The SGI headers
     <pre>
     &lt;bvector&gt;
     &lt;hash_map&gt;
     &lt;hash_set&gt;
     &lt;rope&gt;
     &lt;slist&gt;
     &lt;tree&gt;
     </pre> are all here; <code>&lt;bvector&gt;</code> exposes the old bit_vector
      class that was used before specialization of vector&lt;bool&gt; was
      available (it's actually a typedef for the specialization now).
      <code>&lt;hash_map&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;hash_set&gt;</code>
      are discussed further below.  <code>&lt;rope&gt;</code> is the SGI
      specialization for large strings (&quot;rope,&quot; &quot;large
      strings,&quot; get it?  love those SGI folks).
      <code>&lt;slist&gt;</code> is a singly-linked list, for when the
      doubly-linked <code>list&lt;&gt;</code> is too much space overhead, and
      <code>&lt;tree&gt;</code> exposes the red-black tree classes used in the
      implementation of the standard maps and sets.
   </p>
   <p>Okay, about those hashing classes...  I'm going to foist most of the
      work off onto SGI's own site.
   </p>
   <p>Each of the associative containers map, multimap, set, and multiset
      have a counterpart which uses a
      <a href="http://www.sgi.com/Technology/STL/HashFunction.html">hashing
      function</a> to do the arranging, instead of a strict weak ordering
      function.  The classes take as one of their template parameters a
      function object that will return the hash value; by default, an
      instantiation of
      <a href="http://www.sgi.com/Technology/STL/hash.html">hash</a>.
      You should specialize this functor for your class, or define your own,
      before trying to use one of the hashing classes.
   </p>
   <p>The hashing classes support all the usual associative container
      functions, as well as some extra constructors specifying the number
      of buckets, etc.
   </p>
   <p>Why would you want to use a hashing class instead of the
      &quot;normal&quot; implementations?  Matt Austern writes:
      <blockquote><em>[W]ith a well chosen hash function, hash tables
      generally provide much better average-case performance than binary
      search trees, and much worse worst-case performance.  So if your
      implementation has hash_map, if you don't mind using nonstandard
      components, and if you aren't scared about the possibility of
      pathological cases, you'll probably get better performance from
      hash_map.</em></blockquote>
   </p>
   <p>(Side note:  for those of you wondering, <strong>&quot;Why wasn't a hash
      table included in the Standard in the first #!$@ place?&quot;</strong>
      I'll give a quick answer:  it was proposed, but too late and in too
      unorganized a fashion.  Some sort of hashing will undoubtedly be
      included in a future Standard.

<h2><a name="2">Added members and types</a></h2>
   <p>Some of the classes in the Standard Library have additional
      publicly-available members, and some classes are themselves not in
      the standard.  Of those, some are intended purely for the implementors,
      for example, additional typedefs.  Those won't be described here
      (or anywhere else).
   </p>
   <p>
    <ul>
     <li>The extensions added by SGI are so numerous that they have
         <a href="sgiexts.html">their own page</a>.  Since the SGI STL is no
         longer actively maintained, we will try and keep this code working
         ourselves.</li>
     <li><code>filebuf</code>s have another ctor with this signature:<br>
<code>basic_filebuf(__c_file_type*, ios_base::openmode, int_type);</code>
         <br>This comes in very handy in a number of places, such as
         attaching Unix sockets, pipes, and anything else which uses file
         descriptors, into the IOStream buffering classes.  The three
         arguments are as follows:
         <ul>
          <li><code>__c_file_type*      F   </code>
              // the __c_file_type typedef usually boils down to stdio's FILE
          <li><code>ios_base::openmode  M   </code>
              // same as all the other uses of openmode
          <li><code>int_type            B   </code>
              // buffer size, defaults to BUFSIZ if not specified
         </ul>
         For those wanting to use file descriptors instead of FILE*'s, I
         invite you to contemplate the mysteries of C's <code>fdopen()</code>.
         </li>
     <li>In library snapshot 3.0.95 and later, <code>filebuf</code>s bring
         back an old extension:  the <code>fd()</code> member function.  The
         integer returned from this function can be used for whatever file
         descriptors can be used for on your platform.  Naturally, the
         library cannot track what you do on your own with a file descriptor,
         so if you perform any I/O directly, don't expect the library to be
         aware of it.

<h2><a name="3">Allocators</a></h2>
   <p>Thread-safety, space efficiency, high speed, portability... this is a
      mess.  Where to begin?
   </p>
   <h3>The Rules</h3>
   <p>The C++ standard only gives a few directives in this area:
     <ul>
     <li>When you add elements to a container, and the container must allocate
         more memory to hold them, the container makes the request via its
         <code>Allocator</code> template parameter.  This includes adding
         char's to the string class, which acts as a regular STL container
         in this respect.
     <li>The default <code>Allocator</code> of every container-of-T is
         <code>std::allocator&lt;T&gt;</code>.
     <li>The interface of the <code>allocator&lt;T&gt;</code> class is
         extremely simple.  It has about 20 public declarations (nested
         typedefs, member functions, etc), but the two which concern us most
         are:
         <pre>
      T*    allocate   (size_type n, const void* hint = 0);
      void  deallocate (T* p, size_type n);</pre>
         (This is a simplicifcation; the real signatures use nested typedefs.)
         The <code>&quot;n&quot;</code> arguments in both those functions is a
         <em>count</em> of the number of T's to allocate space for,
         <em>not their total size</em>.
     <li>&quot;The storage is obtained by calling
         <code>::operator new(size_t)</code>, but it is unspecified when or
         how often this function is called.  The use of <code>hint</code>
         is unspecified, but intended as an aid to locality if an
         implementation so desires.&quot; [20.4.1.1]/6
     </ul>
   </p>
   <h3>Problems and Possibilities</h3>
   <p>The easiest way of fulfilling the requirements is to call operator new
      each time a container needs memory, and to call operator delete each
      time the container releases memory.  <strong>BUT</strong>
      <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/libstdc++/2001-05/msg00105.html">this
      method is horribly slow</a>.
   </p>
   <p>Or we can keep old memory around, and reuse it in a pool to save time.
      The old libstdc++-v2 used a memory pool, and so do we.  As of 3.0,
      <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/libstdc++/2001-05/msg00136.html">it's
      on by default</a>.  The pool is shared among all the containers in the
      program:  when your program's std::vector&lt;int&gt; gets cut in half
      and frees a bunch of its storage, that memory can be reused by the
      private std::list&lt;WonkyWidget&gt; brought in from a KDE library
      that you linked against.  And we don't have to call operators new and
      delete to pass the memory on, either, which is a speed bonus.
      <strong>BUT</strong>...
   </p>
   <p>What about threads?  No problem:  in a threadsafe environment, the
      memory pool is manipulated atomically, so you can grow a container in
      one thread and shrink it in another, etc.  <strong>BUT</strong> what
      if threads in libstdc++-v3 aren't set up properly?
      <a href="../faq/index.html#5_6">That's been answered already</a>.
   </p>
   <p><strong>BUT</strong> what if you want to use your own allocator?  What
      if you plan on using a runtime-loadable version of malloc() which uses
      shared telepathic anonymous mmap'd sections serializable over a
      network, so that memory requests <em>should</em> go through malloc?
      And what if you need to debug it?
   </p>
   <p>Well then:
   </p>
   <h3>Available allocators in namespace std</h3>
   <p>First I'll describe the situation as it exists for the code which will
      be released in GCC 3.1.  This situation is extremely fluid.  Then I'll
      describe the differences for 3.0.x, which will not change much in
      this respect.
   </p>
   <p>As a general rule of thumb, users are not allowed to use names which
      begin with an underscore.  This means that to be portable between
      compilers, none of the following may be used in your program directly.
      (If you decide to be unportable, then you're free do do what you want,
      but it's not our fault if stuff breaks.)  They are presented here for
      information for maintainers and contributors in addition to users, but
      we will probably make them available for users in 3.1 somehow.
   </p>
   <p>These classes are always available:
     <ul>
     <li><code>__new_alloc</code> simply wraps <code>::operator new</code>
         and <code>::operator delete</code>.
     <li><code>__malloc_alloc_template&lt;int inst&gt;</code> simply wraps
         <code>malloc</code> and <code>free</code>.  There is also a hook
         for an out-of-memory handler (for new/delete this is taken care of
         elsewhere).  The <code>inst</code> parameter is described below.
         This class was called <code>malloc_alloc</code> in earlier versions.
     <li><code>allocator&lt;T&gt;</code> has already been described; it is
         The Standard Allocator for instances of T.  It uses the internal
         <code>__alloc</code> typedef (see below) to satisy its requests.
     <li><code>__simple_alloc&lt;T,A&gt;</code> is a wrapper around another
         allocator, A, which itself is an allocator for instances of T.
         This is primarily used in an internal &quot;allocator traits&quot;
         class which helps encapsulate the different styles of allocators.
     <li><code>__debug_alloc&lt;A&gt;</code> is also a wrapper around an
         arbitrary allocator A.  It passes on slightly increased size
         requests to A, and uses the extra memory to store size information.
         When a pointer is passed to <code>deallocate()</code>, the stored
         size is checked, and assert() is used to guarantee they match.
     <li><code>__allocator&lt;T,A&gt;</code> is an adaptor.  Many of these
         allocator classes have a consistent yet non-standard interface.
         Such classes can be changed to a conforming interface with this
         wrapper:  <code>__allocator&lt;T, __alloc&gt;</code> is thus the
         same as <code>allocator&lt;T&gt;</code>.
     </ul>
   </p>
   <p>An internal typedef, <code> __mem_interface </code>, is defined to be
      <code>__new_alloc</code> by default.
   </p>
   <p>Normally,
      <code> __default_alloc_template&lt;bool thr, int inst&gt; </code>
      is also available.  This is the high-speed pool, called the default
      node allocator.  The reusable memory is shared among identical
      instantiations of
      this type.  It calls through <code>__mem_interface</code> to obtain
      new memory when its lists run out.  If a client container requests a
      block larger than a certain threshold size, then the pool is bypassed,
      and the allocate/deallocate request is passed to
      <code>__mem_interface</code> directly.
   </p>
   <p>Its <code>inst</code> parameter is described below.  The
      <code>thr</code> boolean determines whether the pool should be
      manipulated atomically or not.  Two typedefs are provided:
      <code>__alloc</code> is defined as this node allocator with thr=true,
      and therefore is threadsafe, while <code>__single_client_alloc</code>
      defines thr=false, and is slightly faster but unsafe for multiple
      threads.
   </p>
   <p>(Note that the GCC thread abstraction layer allows us to provide safe
      zero-overhead stubs for the threading routines, if threads were
      disabled at configuration time.  In this situation,
      <code>__alloc</code> should not be noticably slower than
      <code>__single_client_alloc</code>.)
   </p>
   <p>[Another threadsafe allocator where each thread keeps its own free
      list, so that no locking is needed, might be described here.]
   </p>
   <h3>A cannon to swat a fly:<code>  __USE_MALLOC</code></h3>
   <p>If you've already read <a href="../23_containers/howto.html#3">this
      advice</a> and decided to define this macro, then the situation changes
      thusly:
     <ol>
     <li><code>__mem_interface</code>, and
     <li><code>__alloc</code>, and
     <li><code>__single_client_alloc</code> are all typedef'd to
         <code>__malloc_alloc_template</code>.
     <li><code>__default_alloc_template</code> is no longer available.
         At all.  Anywhere.  <!-- might change? -->
     </ol>
   </p>
   <h3>Writing your own allocators</h3>
   <p>Depending on your application (a specific program, a generic library,
      etc), allocator classes tend to be one of two styles:  &quot;SGI&quot;
      or &quot;standard&quot;.  See the comments in stl_alloc.h for more
      information on this crucial difference.
   </p>
   <p>At the bottom of that header is a helper type,
      <code>_Alloc_traits</code>, and various specializations of it.  This
      allows the container classes to make possible compile-time
      optimizations based on features of the allocator.  You should provide
      a specialization of this type for your allocator (doing so takes only
      two or three statements).
   </p>
   <h3>Using non-default allocators</h3>
   <p>You can specify different memory management schemes on a per-container
      basis, by overriding the default <code>Allocator</code> template
      parameter.  For example, an easy
      (but nonportable)
      method of specifying that only malloc/free should be used instead of
      the default node allocator is:
      <pre>
    std::list &lt;my_type, std::__malloc_alloc_template&lt;0&gt; &gt;  my_malloc_based_list;</pre>
      Likewise, a debugging form of whichever allocator is currently in use:
      <pre>
    std::deque &lt;my_type, std::__debug_alloc&lt;std::__alloc&gt; &gt;  debug_deque;</pre>
   </p>
   <h3><code>inst</code></h3>
   <p>The <code>__malloc_alloc_template</code> and
      <code>__default_alloc_template</code> classes take an integer parameter,
      called inst here.  This number is completely unused.
   </p>
   <p>The point of the number is to allow multiple instantiations of the
      classes without changing the semantics at all.  All three of
      <pre>
    typedef  __default_alloc_template&lt;true,0&gt;    normal;
    typedef  __default_alloc_template&lt;true,1&gt;    private;
    typedef  __default_alloc_template&lt;true,42&gt;   also_private;</pre>
      behave exactly the same way.  However, the memory pool for each type
      (and remember that different instantiations result in different types)
      remains separate.
   </p>
   <p>The library uses <strong>0</strong> in all its instantiations.  If you
      wish to keep separate free lists for a particular purpose, use a
      different number.
   </p>
   <h3>3.0.x</h3>
   <p>For 3.0.x, many of the names were incorrectly <em>not</em> prefixed
      with underscores.  So symbols such as &quot;std::single_client_alloc&quot;
      are present.  Be very careful to not depend on these names any more
      than you would depend on implementation-only names.
   </p>
   <p>Certain macros like <code>_NOTHREADS</code> and <code>__STL_THREADS</code>
      can affect the 3.0.x allocators.  Do not use them.  Those macros have
      been completely removed for 3.1.

<h2><a name="5">LWG Issues</a></h2>
   <p>Everybody's got issues.  Even the C++ Standard Library.
   </p>
   <p>The Library Working Group, or LWG, is the ISO subcommittee responsible
      for making changes to the library.  They periodically publish an
      Issues List containing problems and possible solutions.  As they reach
      a consensus on proposed solutions, we often incorporate the solution
      into libstdc++-v3.
   </p>
   <p>Here are the issues which have resulted in code changes to the library.
      The links are to the specific defect reports from a <strong>partial
      copy</strong> of the Issues List.  You can read the full version online
      at the <a href="http://www.dkuug.dk/jtc1/sc22/wg21/">ISO C++
      Committee homepage</a>, linked to on the
      <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/readings.html">GCC &quot;Readings&quot;
      page</a>.  If
      you spend a lot of time reading the issues, we recommend downloading
      the ZIP file and reading them locally.
   </p>
   <p>(NB:  <strong>partial copy</strong> means that not all links within
      the lwg-*.html pages will work.
      Specifically, links to defect reports that have not been accorded full
      DR status will probably break.  Rather than trying to mirror the

    <dd>The <code>binder1st</code> and <code>binder2nd</code> didn't have an
        <code>operator()</code> taking a non-const parameter.

    <dt><a href="lwg-defects.html#110">110</a>:
        <em>istreambuf_iterator::equal not const</em>
    <dd>This was not a const member function.  Note that the DR says to
        replace the function with a const one; we have instead provided an
        overloaded version with identical contents.

    <dt><a href="lwg-defects.html#117">117</a>:
        <em>basic_ostream uses nonexistent num_put member functions</em>
    <dd><code>num_put::put()</code> was overloaded on the wrong types.

    <dt><a href="lwg-defects.html#118">118</a>:
        <em>basic_istream uses nonexistent num_get member functions</em>
    <dd>Same as 117, but for <code>num_get::get()</code>.

    <dt><a href="lwg-defects.html#129">129</a>:
        <em>Need error indication from seekp() and seekg()</em>
    <dd>These functions set <code>failbit</code> on error now.

    <dt><a href="lwg-defects.html#136">136</a>:
        <em>seekp, seekg setting wrong streams?</em>
    <dd><code>seekp</code> should only set the output stream, and
        <code>seekg</code> should only set the input stream.

<!--<dt><a href="lwg-defects.html#159">159</a>:
        <em>Strange use of underflow()</em>
    <dd>In fstream.tcc, the basic_filebuf&lt;&gt;::showmanyc() function
        should probably not be calling <code>underflow()</code>.-->

    <dt><a href="lwg-active.html#167">167</a>:
        <em>Improper use of traits_type::length()</em>
    <dd><code>op&lt;&lt;</code> with a <code>const char*</code> was
        calculating an incorrect number of characters to write.

    <dt><a href="lwg-defects.html#181">181</a>:
        <em>make_pair() unintended behavior</em>
    <dd>This function used to take its arguments as reference-to-const, now
        it copies them (pass by value).

    <dt><a href="lwg-defects.html#195">195</a>:
        <em>Should basic_istream::sentry's constructor ever set eofbit?</em>
    <dd>Yes, it can, specifically if EOF is reached while skipping whitespace.

    <dt><a href="lwg-defects.html#211">211</a>:
        <em>operator&gt;&gt;(istream&amp;, string&amp;) doesn't set failbit</em>
    <dd>If nothing is extracted into the string, <code>op&gt;&gt;</code> now
        sets <code>failbit</code> (which can cause an exception, etc, etc).

    <dt><a href="lwg-defects.html#214">214</a>:
        <em>set::find() missing const overload</em>
    <dd>Both <code>set</code> and <code>multiset</code> were missing
        overloaded find, lower_bound, upper_bound, and equal_range functions
        for const instances.

    <dt><a href="lwg-defects.html#251">251</a>:
        <em>basic_stringbuf missing allocator_type</em>
    <dd>This nested typdef was originally not specified.

    <dt><a href="lwg-defects.html#265">265</a>:
        <em>std::pair::pair() effects overly restrictive</em>
    <dd>The default ctor would build its members from copies of temporaries;
        now it simply uses their respective default ctors.

    <dt><a href="lwg-defects.html#266">266</a>:
        <em>bad_exception::~bad_exception() missing Effects clause</em>
    <dd>The <code>bad_</code>* classes no longer have destructors (they
        are trivial), since no description of them was ever given.

    <dt><a href="lwg-defects.html#275">275</a>:
        <em>Wrong type in num_get::get() overloads</em>
    <dd>Similar to 118.
