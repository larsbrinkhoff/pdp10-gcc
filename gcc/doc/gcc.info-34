Output of Assembler Instructions
--------------------------------

   This describes assembler instruction output.

`REGISTER_NAMES'
     A C initializer containing the assembler's names for the machine
     registers, each one as a C string constant.  This is what
     translates register numbers in the compiler into assembler
     language.

`ADDITIONAL_REGISTER_NAMES'
     If defined, a C initializer for an array of structures containing
     a name and a register number.  This macro defines additional names
     for hard registers, thus allowing the `asm' option in declarations
     to refer to registers using alternate names.

`ASM_OUTPUT_OPCODE (STREAM, PTR)'
     Define this macro if you are using an unusual assembler that
     requires different names for the machine instructions.

     The definition is a C statement or statements which output an
     assembler instruction opcode to the stdio stream STREAM.  The
     macro-operand PTR is a variable of type `char *' which points to
     the opcode name in its "internal" form--the form that is written
     in the machine description.  The definition should output the
     opcode name to STREAM, performing any translation you desire, and
     increment the variable PTR to point at the end of the opcode so
     that it will not be output twice.

     In fact, your macro definition may process less than the entire
     opcode name, or more than the opcode name; but if you want to
     process text that includes `%'-sequences to substitute operands,
     you must take care of the substitution yourself.  Just be sure to
     increment PTR over whatever text should not be output normally.

     If you need to look at the operand values, they can be found as the
     elements of `recog_operand'.

     If the macro definition does nothing, the instruction is output in
     the usual way.

`FINAL_PRESCAN_INSN (INSN, OPVEC, NOPERANDS)'
     If defined, a C statement to be executed just prior to the output
     of assembler code for INSN, to modify the extracted operands so
     they will be output differently.

     Here the argument OPVEC is the vector containing the operands
     extracted from INSN, and NOPERANDS is the number of elements of
     the vector which contain meaningful data for this insn.  The
     contents of this vector are what will be used to convert the insn
     template into assembler code, so you can change the assembler
     output by changing the contents of the vector.

     This macro is useful when various assembler syntaxes share a single
     file of instruction patterns; by defining this macro differently,
     you can cause a large class of instructions to be output
     differently (such as with rearranged operands).  Naturally,
     variations in assembler syntax affecting individual insn patterns
     ought to be handled by writing conditional output routines in
     those patterns.

     If this macro is not defined, it is equivalent to a null statement.

`FINAL_PRESCAN_LABEL'
     If defined, `FINAL_PRESCAN_INSN' will be called on each
     `CODE_LABEL'.  In that case, OPVEC will be a null pointer and
     NOPERANDS will be zero.

`PRINT_OPERAND (STREAM, X, CODE)'
     A C compound statement to output to stdio stream STREAM the
     assembler syntax for an instruction operand X.  X is an RTL
     expression.

     CODE is a value that can be used to specify one of several ways of
     printing the operand.  It is used when identical operands must be
     printed differently depending on the context.  CODE comes from the
     `%' specification that was used to request printing of the
     operand.  If the specification was just `%DIGIT' then CODE is 0;
     if the specification was `%LTR DIGIT' then CODE is the ASCII code
     for LTR.

     If X is a register, this macro should print the register's name.
     The names can be found in an array `reg_names' whose type is `char
     *[]'.  `reg_names' is initialized from `REGISTER_NAMES'.

     When the machine description has a specification `%PUNCT' (a `%'
     followed by a punctuation character), this macro is called with a
     null pointer for X and the punctuation character for CODE.

`PRINT_OPERAND_PUNCT_VALID_P (CODE)'
     A C expression which evaluates to true if CODE is a valid
     punctuation character for use in the `PRINT_OPERAND' macro.  If
     `PRINT_OPERAND_PUNCT_VALID_P' is not defined, it means that no
     punctuation characters (except for the standard one, `%') are used
     in this way.

`PRINT_OPERAND_ADDRESS (STREAM, X)'
     A C compound statement to output to stdio stream STREAM the
     assembler syntax for an instruction operand that is a memory
     reference whose address is X.  X is an RTL expression.

     On some machines, the syntax for a symbolic address depends on the
     section that the address refers to.  On these machines, define the
     macro `ENCODE_SECTION_INFO' to store the information into the
     `symbol_ref', and then check for it here.  *Note Assembler
     Format::.

`DBR_OUTPUT_SEQEND(FILE)'
     A C statement, to be executed after all slot-filler instructions
     have been output.  If necessary, call `dbr_sequence_length' to
     determine the number of slots filled in a sequence (zero if not
     currently outputting a sequence), to decide how many no-ops to
     output, or whatever.

     Don't define this macro if it has nothing to do, but it is helpful
     in reading assembly output if the extent of the delay sequence is
     made explicit (e.g. with white space).

     Note that output routines for instructions with delay slots must be
     prepared to deal with not being output as part of a sequence (i.e.
     when the scheduling pass is not run, or when no slot fillers could
     be found.)  The variable `final_sequence' is null when not
     processing a sequence, otherwise it contains the `sequence' rtx
     being output.

`REGISTER_PREFIX'
`LOCAL_LABEL_PREFIX'
`USER_LABEL_PREFIX'
`IMMEDIATE_PREFIX'
     If defined, C string expressions to be used for the `%R', `%L',
     `%U', and `%I' options of `asm_fprintf' (see `final.c').  These
     are useful when a single `md' file must support multiple assembler
     formats.  In that case, the various `tm.h' files can define these
     macros differently.

`ASM_FPRINTF_EXTENSIONS(FILE, ARGPTR, FORMAT)'
     If defined this macro should expand to a series of `case'
     statements which will be parsed inside the `switch' statement of
     the `asm_fprintf' function.  This allows targets to define extra
     printf formats which may useful when generating their assembler
     statements.  Note that upper case letters are reserved for future
     generic extensions to asm_fprintf, and so are not available to
     target specific code.  The output file is given by the parameter
     FILE.  The varargs input pointer is ARGPTR and the rest of the
     format string, starting the character after the one that is being
     switched upon, is pointed to by FORMAT.

`ASSEMBLER_DIALECT'
     If your target supports multiple dialects of assembler language
     (such as different opcodes), define this macro as a C expression
     that gives the numeric index of the assembler language dialect to
     use, with zero as the first variant.

     If this macro is defined, you may use constructs of the form
          `{option0|option1|option2...}'

     in the output templates of patterns (*note Output Template::) or
     in the first argument of `asm_fprintf'.  This construct outputs
     `option0', `option1', `option2', etc., if the value of
     `ASSEMBLER_DIALECT' is zero, one, two, etc.  Any special characters
     within these strings retain their usual meaning.  If there are
     fewer alternatives within the braces than the value of
     `ASSEMBLER_DIALECT', the construct outputs nothing.

     If you do not define this macro, the characters `{', `|' and `}'
     do not have any special meaning when used in templates or operands
     to `asm_fprintf'.

     Define the macros `REGISTER_PREFIX', `LOCAL_LABEL_PREFIX',
     `USER_LABEL_PREFIX' and `IMMEDIATE_PREFIX' if you can express the
     variations in assembler language syntax with that mechanism.
     Define `ASSEMBLER_DIALECT' and use the `{option0|option1}' syntax
     if the syntax variant are larger and involve such things as
     different opcodes or operand order.

`ASM_OUTPUT_REG_PUSH (STREAM, REGNO)'
     A C expression to output to STREAM some assembler code which will
     push hard register number REGNO onto the stack.  The code need not
     be optimal, since this macro is used only when profiling.

`ASM_OUTPUT_REG_POP (STREAM, REGNO)'
     A C expression to output to STREAM some assembler code which will
     pop hard register number REGNO off of the stack.  The code need
     not be optimal, since this macro is used only when profiling.


File: gcc.info,  Node: Dispatch Tables,  Next: Exception Region Output,  Prev: Instruction Output,  Up: Assembler Format

Output of Dispatch Tables
-------------------------

   This concerns dispatch tables.

`ASM_OUTPUT_ADDR_DIFF_ELT (STREAM, BODY, VALUE, REL)'
     A C statement to output to the stdio stream STREAM an assembler
     pseudo-instruction to generate a difference between two labels.
     VALUE and REL are the numbers of two internal labels.  The
     definitions of these labels are output using
     `ASM_OUTPUT_INTERNAL_LABEL', and they must be printed in the same
     way here.  For example,

          fprintf (STREAM, "\t.word L%d-L%d\n",
                   VALUE, REL)

     You must provide this macro on machines where the addresses in a
     dispatch table are relative to the table's own address.  If
     defined, GCC will also use this macro on all machines when
     producing PIC.  BODY is the body of the `ADDR_DIFF_VEC'; it is
     provided so that the mode and flags can be read.

`ASM_OUTPUT_ADDR_VEC_ELT (STREAM, VALUE)'
     This macro should be provided on machines where the addresses in a
     dispatch table are absolute.

     The definition should be a C statement to output to the stdio
     stream STREAM an assembler pseudo-instruction to generate a
     reference to a label.  VALUE is the number of an internal label
     whose definition is output using `ASM_OUTPUT_INTERNAL_LABEL'.  For
     example,

          fprintf (STREAM, "\t.word L%d\n", VALUE)

`ASM_OUTPUT_CASE_LABEL (STREAM, PREFIX, NUM, TABLE)'
     Define this if the label before a jump-table needs to be output
     specially.  The first three arguments are the same as for
     `ASM_OUTPUT_INTERNAL_LABEL'; the fourth argument is the jump-table
     which follows (a `jump_insn' containing an `addr_vec' or
     `addr_diff_vec').

     This feature is used on system V to output a `swbeg' statement for
     the table.

     If this macro is not defined, these labels are output with
     `ASM_OUTPUT_INTERNAL_LABEL'.

`ASM_OUTPUT_CASE_END (STREAM, NUM, TABLE)'
     Define this if something special must be output at the end of a
     jump-table.  The definition should be a C statement to be executed
     after the assembler code for the table is written.  It should write
     the appropriate code to stdio stream STREAM.  The argument TABLE
     is the jump-table insn, and NUM is the label-number of the
     preceding label.

     If this macro is not defined, nothing special is output at the end
     of the jump-table.


File: gcc.info,  Node: Exception Region Output,  Next: Alignment Output,  Prev: Dispatch Tables,  Up: Assembler Format

Assembler Commands for Exception Regions
----------------------------------------

   This describes commands marking the start and the end of an exception
region.

`ASM_OUTPUT_EH_REGION_BEG ()'
     A C expression to output text to mark the start of an exception
     region.

     This macro need not be defined on most platforms.

`ASM_OUTPUT_EH_REGION_END ()'
     A C expression to output text to mark the end of an exception
     region.

     This macro need not be defined on most platforms.

`EH_FRAME_SECTION_NAME'
     If defined, a C string constant for the name of the section
     containing exception handling frame unwind information.  If not
     defined, GCC will provide a default definition if the target
     supports named sections.  `crtstuff.c' uses this macro to switch
     to the appropriate section.

     You should define this symbol if your target supports DWARF 2 frame
     unwind information and the default definition does not work.

`EH_FRAME_IN_DATA_SECTION'
     If defined, DWARF 2 frame unwind information will be placed in the
     data section even though the target supports named sections.  This
     might be necessary, for instance, if the system linker does garbage
     collection and sections cannot be marked as not to be collected.

     Do not define this macro unless `TARGET_ASM_NAMED_SECTION' is also
     defined.

`OMIT_EH_TABLE ()'
     A C expression that is nonzero if the normal exception table output
     should be omitted.

     This macro need not be defined on most platforms.

`EH_TABLE_LOOKUP ()'
     Alternate runtime support for looking up an exception at runtime
     and finding the associated handler, if the default method won't
     work.

     This macro need not be defined on most platforms.

`DOESNT_NEED_UNWINDER'
     A C expression that decides whether or not the current function
     needs to have a function unwinder generated for it.  See the file
     `except.c' for details on when to define this, and how.

`MASK_RETURN_ADDR'
     An rtx used to mask the return address found via
     `RETURN_ADDR_RTX', so that it does not contain any extraneous set
     bits in it.

`DWARF2_UNWIND_INFO'
     Define this macro to 0 if your target supports DWARF 2 frame unwind
     information, but it does not yet work with exception handling.
     Otherwise, if your target supports this information (if it defines
     `INCOMING_RETURN_ADDR_RTX' and either `UNALIGNED_INT_ASM_OP' or
     `OBJECT_FORMAT_ELF'), GCC will provide a default definition of 1.

     If this macro is defined to 1, the DWARF 2 unwinder will be the
     default exception handling mechanism; otherwise,
     `setjmp'/`longjmp' will be used by default.

     If this macro is defined to anything, the DWARF 2 unwinder will be
     used instead of inline unwinders and `__unwind_function' in the
     non-`setjmp' case.

`DWARF_CIE_DATA_ALIGNMENT'
     This macro need only be defined if the target might save registers
     in the function prologue at an offset to the stack pointer that is
     not aligned to `UNITS_PER_WORD'.  The definition should be the
     negative minimum alignment if `STACK_GROWS_DOWNWARD' is defined,
     and the positive minimum alignment otherwise.  *Note SDB and
     DWARF::.  Only applicable if the target supports DWARF 2 frame
     unwind information.

 - Target Hook: void TARGET_ASM_EXCEPTION_SECTION ()
     If defined, a function that switches to the section in which the
     main exception table is to be placed (*note Sections::).  The
     default is a function that switches to a section named
     `.gcc_except_table' on machines that support named sections via
     `TARGET_ASM_NAMED_SECTION', otherwise if `-fpic' or `-fPIC' is in
     effect, the `data_section', otherwise the `readonly_data_section'.

 - Target Hook: void TARGET_ASM_EH_FRAME_SECTION ()
     If defined, a function that switches to the section in which the
     DWARF 2 frame unwind information to be placed (*note Sections::).
     The default is a function that outputs a standard GAS section
     directive, if `EH_FRAME_SECTION_NAME' is defined, or else a data
     section directive followed by a synthetic label.


File: gcc.info,  Node: Alignment Output,  Prev: Exception Region Output,  Up: Assembler Format

Assembler Commands for Alignment
--------------------------------

   This describes commands for alignment.

`JUMP_ALIGN (LABEL)'
     The alignment (log base 2) to put in front of LABEL, which is a
     common destination of jumps and has no fallthru incoming edge.

     This macro need not be defined if you don't want any special
     alignment to be done at such a time.  Most machine descriptions do
     not currently define the macro.

     Unless it's necessary to inspect the LABEL parameter, it is better
     to set the variable ALIGN_JUMPS in the target's
     `OVERRIDE_OPTIONS'.  Otherwise, you should try to honor the user's
     selection in ALIGN_JUMPS in a `JUMP_ALIGN' implementation.

`LABEL_ALIGN_AFTER_BARRIER (LABEL)'
     The alignment (log base 2) to put in front of LABEL, which follows
     a `BARRIER'.

     This macro need not be defined if you don't want any special
     alignment to be done at such a time.  Most machine descriptions do
     not currently define the macro.

`LABEL_ALIGN_AFTER_BARRIER_MAX_SKIP'
     The maximum number of bytes to skip when applying
     `LABEL_ALIGN_AFTER_BARRIER'.  This works only if
     `ASM_OUTPUT_MAX_SKIP_ALIGN' is defined.

`LOOP_ALIGN (LABEL)'
     The alignment (log base 2) to put in front of LABEL, which follows
     a `NOTE_INSN_LOOP_BEG' note.

     This macro need not be defined if you don't want any special
     alignment to be done at such a time.  Most machine descriptions do
     not currently define the macro.

     Unless it's necessary to inspect the LABEL parameter, it is better
     to set the variable `align_loops' in the target's
     `OVERRIDE_OPTIONS'.  Otherwise, you should try to honor the user's
     selection in `align_loops' in a `LOOP_ALIGN' implementation.

`LOOP_ALIGN_MAX_SKIP'
     The maximum number of bytes to skip when applying `LOOP_ALIGN'.
     This works only if `ASM_OUTPUT_MAX_SKIP_ALIGN' is defined.

`LABEL_ALIGN (LABEL)'
     The alignment (log base 2) to put in front of LABEL.  If
     `LABEL_ALIGN_AFTER_BARRIER' / `LOOP_ALIGN' specify a different
     alignment, the maximum of the specified values is used.

     Unless it's necessary to inspect the LABEL parameter, it is better
     to set the variable `align_labels' in the target's
     `OVERRIDE_OPTIONS'.  Otherwise, you should try to honor the user's
     selection in `align_labels' in a `LABEL_ALIGN' implementation.

`LABEL_ALIGN_MAX_SKIP'
     The maximum number of bytes to skip when applying `LABEL_ALIGN'.
     This works only if `ASM_OUTPUT_MAX_SKIP_ALIGN' is defined.

`ASM_OUTPUT_SKIP (STREAM, NBYTES)'
     A C statement to output to the stdio stream STREAM an assembler
     instruction to advance the location counter by NBYTES bytes.
     Those bytes should be zero when loaded.  NBYTES will be a C
     expression of type `int'.

`ASM_NO_SKIP_IN_TEXT'
     Define this macro if `ASM_OUTPUT_SKIP' should not be used in the
     text section because it fails to put zeros in the bytes that are
     skipped.  This is true on many Unix systems, where the pseudo-op
     to skip bytes produces no-op instructions rather than zeros when
     used in the text section.

`ASM_OUTPUT_ALIGN (STREAM, POWER)'
     A C statement to output to the stdio stream STREAM an assembler
     command to advance the location counter to a multiple of 2 to the
     POWER bytes.  POWER will be a C expression of type `int'.

`ASM_OUTPUT_MAX_SKIP_ALIGN (STREAM, POWER, MAX_SKIP)'
     A C statement to output to the stdio stream STREAM an assembler
     command to advance the location counter to a multiple of 2 to the
     POWER bytes, but only if MAX_SKIP or fewer bytes are needed to
     satisfy the alignment request.  POWER and MAX_SKIP will be a C
     expression of type `int'.

File: gcc.info,  Node: All Debuggers,  Next: DBX Options,  Up: Debugging Info

Macros Affecting All Debugging Formats
--------------------------------------

   These macros affect all debugging formats.

`DBX_REGISTER_NUMBER (REGNO)'
     A C expression that returns the DBX register number for the
     compiler register number REGNO.  In the default macro provided,
     the value of this expression will be REGNO itself.  But sometimes
     there are some registers that the compiler knows about and DBX
     does not, or vice versa.  In such cases, some register may need to
     have one number in the compiler and another for DBX.

     If two registers have consecutive numbers inside GCC, and they can
     be used as a pair to hold a multiword value, then they _must_ have
     consecutive numbers after renumbering with `DBX_REGISTER_NUMBER'.
     Otherwise, debuggers will be unable to access such a pair, because
     they expect register pairs to be consecutive in their own
     numbering scheme.

     If you find yourself defining `DBX_REGISTER_NUMBER' in way that
     does not preserve register pairs, then what you must do instead is
     redefine the actual register numbering scheme.

`DEBUGGER_AUTO_OFFSET (X)'
     A C expression that returns the integer offset value for an
     automatic variable having address X (an RTL expression).  The
     default computation assumes that X is based on the frame-pointer
     and gives the offset from the frame-pointer.  This is required for
     targets that produce debugging output for DBX or COFF-style
     debugging output for SDB and allow the frame-pointer to be
     eliminated when the `-g' options is used.

`DEBUGGER_ARG_OFFSET (OFFSET, X)'
     A C expression that returns the integer offset value for an
     argument having address X (an RTL expression).  The nominal offset
     is OFFSET.

`PREFERRED_DEBUGGING_TYPE'
     A C expression that returns the type of debugging output GCC should
     produce when the user specifies just `-g'.  Define this if you
     have arranged for GCC to support more than one format of debugging
     output.  Currently, the allowable values are `DBX_DEBUG',
     `SDB_DEBUG', `DWARF_DEBUG', `DWARF2_DEBUG', `XCOFF_DEBUG',
     `VMS_DEBUG', and `VMS_AND_DWARF2_DEBUG'.

     When the user specifies `-ggdb', GCC normally also uses the value
     of this macro to select the debugging output format, but with two
     exceptions.  If `DWARF2_DEBUGGING_INFO' is defined and
     `LINKER_DOES_NOT_WORK_WITH_DWARF2' is not defined, GCC uses the
     value `DWARF2_DEBUG'.  Otherwise, if `DBX_DEBUGGING_INFO' is
     defined, GCC uses `DBX_DEBUG'.

     The value of this macro only affects the default debugging output;
     the user can always get a specific type of output by using
     `-gstabs', `-gcoff', `-gdwarf-1', `-gdwarf-2', `-gxcoff', or
     `-gvms'.


File: gcc.info,  Node: DBX Options,  Next: DBX Hooks,  Prev: All Debuggers,  Up: Debugging Info

Specific Options for DBX Output
-------------------------------

   These are specific options for DBX output.

`DBX_DEBUGGING_INFO'
     Define this macro if GCC should produce debugging output for DBX
     in response to the `-g' option.

`XCOFF_DEBUGGING_INFO'
     Define this macro if GCC should produce XCOFF format debugging
     output in response to the `-g' option.  This is a variant of DBX
     format.

`DEFAULT_GDB_EXTENSIONS'
     Define this macro to control whether GCC should by default generate
     GDB's extended version of DBX debugging information (assuming
     DBX-format debugging information is enabled at all).  If you don't
     define the macro, the default is 1: always generate the extended
     information if there is any occasion to.

`DEBUG_SYMS_TEXT'
     Define this macro if all `.stabs' commands should be output while
     in the text section.

`ASM_STABS_OP'
     A C string constant, including spacing, naming the assembler
     pseudo op to use instead of `"\t.stabs\t"' to define an ordinary
     debugging symbol.  If you don't define this macro, `"\t.stabs\t"'
     is used.  This macro applies only to DBX debugging information
     format.

`ASM_STABD_OP'
     A C string constant, including spacing, naming the assembler
     pseudo op to use instead of `"\t.stabd\t"' to define a debugging
     symbol whose value is the current location.  If you don't define
     this macro, `"\t.stabd\t"' is used.  This macro applies only to
     DBX debugging information format.

`ASM_STABN_OP'
     A C string constant, including spacing, naming the assembler
     pseudo op to use instead of `"\t.stabn\t"' to define a debugging
     symbol with no name.  If you don't define this macro,
     `"\t.stabn\t"' is used.  This macro applies only to DBX debugging
     information format.

`DBX_NO_XREFS'
     Define this macro if DBX on your system does not support the
     construct `xsTAGNAME'.  On some systems, this construct is used to
     describe a forward reference to a structure named TAGNAME.  On
     other systems, this construct is not supported at all.

`DBX_CONTIN_LENGTH'
     A symbol name in DBX-format debugging information is normally
     continued (split into two separate `.stabs' directives) when it
     exceeds a certain length (by default, 80 characters).  On some
     operating systems, DBX requires this splitting; on others,
     splitting must not be done.  You can inhibit splitting by defining
     this macro with the value zero.  You can override the default
     splitting-length by defining this macro as an expression for the
     length you desire.

`DBX_CONTIN_CHAR'
     Normally continuation is indicated by adding a `\' character to
     the end of a `.stabs' string when a continuation follows.  To use
     a different character instead, define this macro as a character
     constant for the character you want to use.  Do not define this
     macro if backslash is correct for your system.

`DBX_STATIC_STAB_DATA_SECTION'
     Define this macro if it is necessary to go to the data section
     before outputting the `.stabs' pseudo-op for a non-global static
     variable.

`DBX_TYPE_DECL_STABS_CODE'
     The value to use in the "code" field of the `.stabs' directive for
     a typedef.  The default is `N_LSYM'.

`DBX_STATIC_CONST_VAR_CODE'
     The value to use in the "code" field of the `.stabs' directive for
     a static variable located in the text section.  DBX format does not
     provide any "right" way to do this.  The default is `N_FUN'.

`DBX_REGPARM_STABS_CODE'
     The value to use in the "code" field of the `.stabs' directive for
     a parameter passed in registers.  DBX format does not provide any
     "right" way to do this.  The default is `N_RSYM'.

`DBX_REGPARM_STABS_LETTER'
     The letter to use in DBX symbol data to identify a symbol as a
     parameter passed in registers.  DBX format does not customarily
     provide any way to do this.  The default is `'P''.

`DBX_MEMPARM_STABS_LETTER'
     The letter to use in DBX symbol data to identify a symbol as a
     stack parameter.  The default is `'p''.

`DBX_FUNCTION_FIRST'
     Define this macro if the DBX information for a function and its
     arguments should precede the assembler code for the function.
     Normally, in DBX format, the debugging information entirely
     follows the assembler code.

`DBX_LBRAC_FIRST'
     Define this macro if the `N_LBRAC' symbol for a block should
     precede the debugging information for variables and functions
     defined in that block.  Normally, in DBX format, the `N_LBRAC'
     symbol comes first.

`DBX_BLOCKS_FUNCTION_RELATIVE'
     Define this macro if the value of a symbol describing the scope of
     a block (`N_LBRAC' or `N_RBRAC') should be relative to the start
     of the enclosing function.  Normally, GCC uses an absolute address.

`DBX_USE_BINCL'
     Define this macro if GCC should generate `N_BINCL' and `N_EINCL'
     stabs for included header files, as on Sun systems.  This macro
     also directs GCC to output a type number as a pair of a file
     number and a type number within the file.  Normally, GCC does not
     generate `N_BINCL' or `N_EINCL' stabs, and it outputs a single
     number for a type number.

Open-Ended Hooks for DBX Format
-------------------------------

   These are hooks for DBX format.

`DBX_OUTPUT_LBRAC (STREAM, NAME)'
     Define this macro to say how to output to STREAM the debugging
     information for the start of a scope level for variable names.  The
     argument NAME is the name of an assembler symbol (for use with
     `assemble_name') whose value is the address where the scope begins.

`DBX_OUTPUT_RBRAC (STREAM, NAME)'
     Like `DBX_OUTPUT_LBRAC', but for the end of a scope level.

`DBX_OUTPUT_ENUM (STREAM, TYPE)'
     Define this macro if the target machine requires special handling
     to output an enumeration type.  The definition should be a C
     statement (sans semicolon) to output the appropriate information
     to STREAM for the type TYPE.

`DBX_OUTPUT_FUNCTION_END (STREAM, FUNCTION)'
     Define this macro if the target machine requires special output at
     the end of the debugging information for a function.  The
     definition should be a C statement (sans semicolon) to output the
     appropriate information to STREAM.  FUNCTION is the
     `FUNCTION_DECL' node for the function.

`DBX_OUTPUT_STANDARD_TYPES (SYMS)'
     Define this macro if you need to control the order of output of the
     standard data types at the beginning of compilation.  The argument
     SYMS is a `tree' which is a chain of all the predefined global
     symbols, including names of data types.

     Normally, DBX output starts with definitions of the types for
     integers and characters, followed by all the other predefined
     types of the particular language in no particular order.

     On some machines, it is necessary to output different particular
     types first.  To do this, define `DBX_OUTPUT_STANDARD_TYPES' to
     output those symbols in the necessary order.  Any predefined types
     that you don't explicitly output will be output afterward in no
     particular order.

     Be careful not to define this macro so that it works only for C.
     There are no global variables to access most of the built-in
     types, because another language may have another set of types.
     The way to output a particular type is to look through SYMS to see
     if you can find it.  Here is an example:

          {
            tree decl;
            for (decl = syms; decl; decl = TREE_CHAIN (decl))
              if (!strcmp (IDENTIFIER_POINTER (DECL_NAME (decl)),
                           "long int"))
                dbxout_symbol (decl);
            ...
          }

     This does nothing if the expected type does not exist.

     See the function `init_decl_processing' in `c-decl.c' to find the
     names to use for all the built-in C types.

     Here is another way of finding a particular type:

          {
            tree decl;
            for (decl = syms; decl; decl = TREE_CHAIN (decl))
              if (TREE_CODE (decl) == TYPE_DECL
                  && (TREE_CODE (TREE_TYPE (decl))
                      == INTEGER_CST)
                  && TYPE_PRECISION (TREE_TYPE (decl)) == 16
                  && TYPE_UNSIGNED (TREE_TYPE (decl)))
                /* This must be `unsigned short'.  */
                dbxout_symbol (decl);
            ...
          }

`NO_DBX_FUNCTION_END'
     Some stabs encapsulation formats (in particular ECOFF), cannot
     handle the `.stabs "",N_FUN,,0,0,Lscope-function-1' gdb dbx
     extension construct.  On those machines, define this macro to turn
     this feature off without disturbing the rest of the gdb extensions.

File Names in DBX Format
------------------------

   This describes file names in DBX format.

`DBX_WORKING_DIRECTORY'
     Define this if DBX wants to have the current directory recorded in
     each object file.

     Note that the working directory is always recorded if GDB
     extensions are enabled.

`DBX_OUTPUT_MAIN_SOURCE_FILENAME (STREAM, NAME)'
     A C statement to output DBX debugging information to the stdio
     stream STREAM which indicates that file NAME is the main source
     file--the file specified as the input file for compilation.  This
     macro is called only once, at the beginning of compilation.

     This macro need not be defined if the standard form of output for
     DBX debugging information is appropriate.

`DBX_OUTPUT_MAIN_SOURCE_DIRECTORY (STREAM, NAME)'
     A C statement to output DBX debugging information to the stdio
     stream STREAM which indicates that the current directory during
     compilation is named NAME.

     This macro need not be defined if the standard form of output for
     DBX debugging information is appropriate.

`DBX_OUTPUT_MAIN_SOURCE_FILE_END (STREAM, NAME)'
     A C statement to output DBX debugging information at the end of
     compilation of the main source file NAME.

     If you don't define this macro, nothing special is output at the
     end of compilation, which is correct for most machines.

`DBX_OUTPUT_SOURCE_FILENAME (STREAM, NAME)'
     A C statement to output DBX debugging information to the stdio
     stream STREAM which indicates that file NAME is the current source
     file.  This output is generated each time input shifts to a
     different source file as a result of `#include', the end of an
     included file, or a `#line' command.

     This macro need not be defined if the standard form of output for
     DBX debugging information is appropriate.

Macros for SDB and DWARF Output
-------------------------------

   Here are macros for SDB and DWARF output.

`SDB_DEBUGGING_INFO'
     Define this macro if GCC should produce COFF-style debugging output
     for SDB in response to the `-g' option.

`DWARF_DEBUGGING_INFO'
     Define this macro if GCC should produce dwarf format debugging
     output in response to the `-g' option.

`DWARF2_DEBUGGING_INFO'
     Define this macro if GCC should produce dwarf version 2 format
     debugging output in response to the `-g' option.

     To support optional call frame debugging information, you must also
     define `INCOMING_RETURN_ADDR_RTX' and either set
     `RTX_FRAME_RELATED_P' on the prologue insns if you use RTL for the
     prologue, or call `dwarf2out_def_cfa' and `dwarf2out_reg_save' as
     appropriate from `TARGET_ASM_FUNCTION_PROLOGUE' if you don't.

`DWARF2_FRAME_INFO'
     Define this macro to a nonzero value if GCC should always output
     Dwarf 2 frame information.  If `DWARF2_UNWIND_INFO' (*note
     Exception Region Output:: is nonzero, GCC will output this
     information not matter how you define `DWARF2_FRAME_INFO'.

`LINKER_DOES_NOT_WORK_WITH_DWARF2'
     Define this macro if the linker does not work with Dwarf version 2.
     Normally, if the user specifies only `-ggdb' GCC will use Dwarf
     version 2 if available; this macro disables this.  See the
     description of the `PREFERRED_DEBUGGING_TYPE' macro for more
     details.

`DWARF2_GENERATE_TEXT_SECTION_LABEL'
     By default, the Dwarf 2 debugging information generator will
     generate a label to mark the beginning of the text section.  If it
     is better simply to use the name of the text section itself,
     rather than an explicit label, to indicate the beginning of the
     text section, define this macro to zero.

`DWARF2_ASM_LINE_DEBUG_INFO'
     Define this macro to be a nonzero value if the assembler can
     generate Dwarf 2 line debug info sections.  This will result in
     much more compact line number tables, and hence is desirable if it
     works.

`PUT_SDB_...'
     Define these macros to override the assembler syntax for the
     special SDB assembler directives.  See `sdbout.c' for a list of
     these macros and their arguments.  If the standard syntax is used,
     you need not define them yourself.

`SDB_DELIM'
     Some assemblers do not support a semicolon as a delimiter, even
     between SDB assembler directives.  In that case, define this macro
     to be the delimiter to use (usually `\n').  It is not necessary to
     define a new set of `PUT_SDB_OP' macros if this is the only change
     required.

`SDB_GENERATE_FAKE'
     Define this macro to override the usual method of constructing a
     dummy name for anonymous structure and union types.  See
     `sdbout.c' for more information.

`SDB_ALLOW_UNKNOWN_REFERENCES'
     Define this macro to allow references to unknown structure, union,
     or enumeration tags to be emitted.  Standard COFF does not allow
     handling of unknown references, MIPS ECOFF has support for it.

`SDB_ALLOW_FORWARD_REFERENCES'
     Define this macro to allow references to structure, union, or
     enumeration tags that have not yet been seen to be handled.  Some
     assemblers choke if forward tags are used, while some require it.

Macros for VMS Debug Format
---------------------------

   Here are macros for VMS debug format.

`VMS_DEBUGGING_INFO'
     Define this macro if GCC should produce debugging output for VMS
     in response to the `-g' option.  The default behavior for VMS is
     to generate minimal debug info for a traceback in the absence of
     `-g' unless explicitly overridden with `-g0'.  This behavior is
     controlled by `OPTIMIZATION_OPTIONS' and `OVERRIDE_OPTIONS'.


File: gcc.info,  Node: Cross-compilation,  Next: Mode Switching,  Prev: Debugging Info,  Up: Target Macros

Cross Compilation and Floating Point
====================================

   While all modern machines use 2's complement representation for
integers, there are a variety of representations for floating point
numbers.  This means that in a cross-compiler the representation of
floating point numbers in the compiled program may be different from
that used in the machine doing the compilation.

   Because different representation systems may offer different amounts
of range and precision, the cross compiler cannot safely use the host
machine's floating point arithmetic.  Therefore, floating point
constants must be represented in the target machine's format.  This
means that the cross compiler cannot use `atof' to parse a floating
point constant; it must have its own special routine to use instead.
Also, constant folding must emulate the target machine's arithmetic (or
must not be done at all).

   The macros in the following table should be defined only if you are
cross compiling between different floating point formats.

   Otherwise, don't define them.  Then default definitions will be set
up which use `double' as the data type, `==' to test for equality, etc.

   You don't need to worry about how many times you use an operand of
any of these macros.  The compiler never uses operands which have side
effects.

`REAL_VALUE_TYPE'
     A macro for the C data type to be used to hold a floating point
     value in the target machine's format.  Typically this would be a
     `struct' containing an array of `int'.

`REAL_VALUES_EQUAL (X, Y)'
     A macro for a C expression which compares for equality the two
     values, X and Y, both of type `REAL_VALUE_TYPE'.

`REAL_VALUES_LESS (X, Y)'
     A macro for a C expression which tests whether X is less than Y,
     both values being of type `REAL_VALUE_TYPE' and interpreted as
     floating point numbers in the target machine's representation.

`REAL_VALUE_LDEXP (X, SCALE)'
     A macro for a C expression which performs the standard library
     function `ldexp', but using the target machine's floating point
     representation.  Both X and the value of the expression have type
     `REAL_VALUE_TYPE'.  The second argument, SCALE, is an integer.

`REAL_VALUE_FIX (X)'
     A macro whose definition is a C expression to convert the
     target-machine floating point value X to a signed integer.  X has
     type `REAL_VALUE_TYPE'.

`REAL_VALUE_UNSIGNED_FIX (X)'
     A macro whose definition is a C expression to convert the
     target-machine floating point value X to an unsigned integer.  X
     has type `REAL_VALUE_TYPE'.

`REAL_VALUE_RNDZINT (X)'
     A macro whose definition is a C expression to round the
     target-machine floating point value X towards zero to an integer
     value (but still as a floating point number).  X has type
     `REAL_VALUE_TYPE', and so does the value.

`REAL_VALUE_UNSIGNED_RNDZINT (X)'
     A macro whose definition is a C expression to round the
     target-machine floating point value X towards zero to an unsigned
     integer value (but still represented as a floating point number).
     X has type `REAL_VALUE_TYPE', and so does the value.

`REAL_VALUE_ATOF (STRING, MODE)'
     A macro for a C expression which converts STRING, an expression of
     type `char *', into a floating point number in the target machine's
     representation for mode MODE.  The value has type
     `REAL_VALUE_TYPE'.

`REAL_INFINITY'
     Define this macro if infinity is a possible floating point value,
     and therefore division by 0 is legitimate.

`REAL_VALUE_ISINF (X)'
     A macro for a C expression which determines whether X, a floating
     point value, is infinity.  The value has type `int'.  By default,
     this is defined to call `isinf'.

`REAL_VALUE_ISNAN (X)'
     A macro for a C expression which determines whether X, a floating
     point value, is a "nan" (not-a-number).  The value has type `int'.
     By default, this is defined to call `isnan'.

   Define the following additional macros if you want to make floating
point constant folding work while cross compiling.  If you don't define
them, cross compilation is still possible, but constant folding will
not happen for floating point values.

`REAL_ARITHMETIC (OUTPUT, CODE, X, Y)'
     A macro for a C statement which calculates an arithmetic operation
     of the two floating point values X and Y, both of type
     `REAL_VALUE_TYPE' in the target machine's representation, to
     produce a result of the same type and representation which is
     stored in OUTPUT (which will be a variable).

     The operation to be performed is specified by CODE, a tree code
     which will always be one of the following: `PLUS_EXPR',
     `MINUS_EXPR', `MULT_EXPR', `RDIV_EXPR', `MAX_EXPR', `MIN_EXPR'.

     The expansion of this macro is responsible for checking for
     overflow.  If overflow happens, the macro expansion should execute
     the statement `return 0;', which indicates the inability to
     perform the arithmetic operation requested.

`REAL_VALUE_NEGATE (X)'
     A macro for a C expression which returns the negative of the
     floating point value X.  Both X and the value of the expression
     have type `REAL_VALUE_TYPE' and are in the target machine's
     floating point representation.

     There is no way for this macro to report overflow, since overflow
     can't happen in the negation operation.

`REAL_VALUE_TRUNCATE (MODE, X)'
     A macro for a C expression which converts the floating point value
     X to mode MODE.

     Both X and the value of the expression are in the target machine's
     floating point representation and have type `REAL_VALUE_TYPE'.
     However, the value should have an appropriate bit pattern to be
     output properly as a floating constant whose precision accords
     with mode MODE.

     There is no way for this macro to report overflow.

`REAL_VALUE_TO_INT (LOW, HIGH, X)'
     A macro for a C expression which converts a floating point value X
     into a double-precision integer which is then stored into LOW and
     HIGH, two variables of type INT.

`REAL_VALUE_FROM_INT (X, LOW, HIGH, MODE)'
     A macro for a C expression which converts a double-precision
     integer found in LOW and HIGH, two variables of type INT, into a
     floating point value which is then stored into X.  The value is in
     the target machine's representation for mode MODE and has the type
     `REAL_VALUE_TYPE'.

Mode Switching Instructions
===========================

   The following macros control mode switching optimizations:

`OPTIMIZE_MODE_SWITCHING (ENTITY)'
     Define this macro if the port needs extra instructions inserted
     for mode switching in an optimizing compilation.

     For an example, the SH4 can perform both single and double
     precision floating point operations, but to perform a single
     precision operation, the FPSCR PR bit has to be cleared, while for
     a double precision operation, this bit has to be set.  Changing
     the PR bit requires a general purpose register as a scratch
     register, hence these FPSCR sets have to be inserted before
     reload, i.e. you can't put this into instruction emitting or
     `MACHINE_DEPENDENT_REORG'.

     You can have multiple entities that are mode-switched, and select
     at run time which entities actually need it.
     `OPTIMIZE_MODE_SWITCHING' should return nonzero for any ENTITY
     that needs mode-switching.  If you define this macro, you also
     have to define `NUM_MODES_FOR_MODE_SWITCHING', `MODE_NEEDED',
     `MODE_PRIORITY_TO_MODE' and `EMIT_MODE_SET'.  `NORMAL_MODE' is
     optional.

`NUM_MODES_FOR_MODE_SWITCHING'
     If you define `OPTIMIZE_MODE_SWITCHING', you have to define this as
     initializer for an array of integers.  Each initializer element N
     refers to an entity that needs mode switching, and specifies the
     number of different modes that might need to be set for this
     entity.  The position of the initializer in the initializer -
     starting counting at zero - determines the integer that is used to
     refer to the mode-switched entity in question.  In macros that
     take mode arguments / yield a mode result, modes are represented
     as numbers 0 ... N - 1.  N is used to specify that no mode switch
     is needed / supplied.

`MODE_NEEDED (ENTITY, INSN)'
     ENTITY is an integer specifying a mode-switched entity.  If
     `OPTIMIZE_MODE_SWITCHING' is defined, you must define this macro to
     return an integer value not larger than the corresponding element
     in `NUM_MODES_FOR_MODE_SWITCHING', to denote the mode that ENTITY
     must be switched into prior to the execution of INSN.

`NORMAL_MODE (ENTITY)'
     If this macro is defined, it is evaluated for every ENTITY that
     needs mode switching.  It should evaluate to an integer, which is
     a mode that ENTITY is assumed to be switched to at function entry
     and exit.

`MODE_PRIORITY_TO_MODE (ENTITY, N)'
     This macro specifies the order in which modes for ENTITY are
     processed.  0 is the highest priority,
     `NUM_MODES_FOR_MODE_SWITCHING[ENTITY] - 1' the lowest.  The value
     of the macro should be an integer designating a mode for ENTITY.
     For any fixed ENTITY, `mode_priority_to_mode' (ENTITY, N) shall be
     a bijection in 0 ...  `num_modes_for_mode_switching[ENTITY] - 1'.

`EMIT_MODE_SET (ENTITY, MODE, HARD_REGS_LIVE)'
     Generate one or more insns to set ENTITY to MODE.  HARD_REG_LIVE
     is the set of hard registers live at the point where the insn(s)
     are to be inserted.
