PowerPC AltiVec Built-in Functions
----------------------------------

   These built-in functions are available for the PowerPC family of
computers, depending on the command-line switches used.

   The following machine modes are available for use with AltiVec
built-in functions (*note Vector Extensions::): `V4SI' for a vector of
four 32-bit integers, `V4SF' for a vector of four 32-bit floating point
numbers, `V8HI' for a vector of eight 16-bit integers, and `V16QI' for
a vector of sixteen 8-bit integers.

   The following functions are made available by including
`<altivec.h>' and using `-maltivec' and `-mabi=altivec'.  The functions
implement the functionality described in Motorola's AltiVec Programming
Interface Manual.

   _Note:_ Only the `<altivec.h>' interface is supported.  Internally,
GCC uses built-in functions to achieve the functionality in the
aforementioned header file, but they are not supported and are subject
to change without notice.
