   -- Polling Interface --
   -----------------------

   --  The GNAT compiler has an option to generate polling calls to the Poll
   --  routine in this package. Specifying the -gnatP option for a compilation
   --  causes a call to Ada.Exceptions.Poll to be generated on every subprogram
   --  entry and on every iteration of a loop, thus avoiding the possibility of
   --  a case of unbounded time between calls.

   --  This polling interface may be used for instrumentation or debugging
   --  purposes (e.g. implementing watchpoints in software or in the debugger).

   --  In the GNAT technology itself, this interface is used to implement
   --  immediate aynschronous transfer of control and immediate abort on
   --  targets which do not provide for one thread interrupting another.

   --  Note: this used to be in a separate unit called System.Poll, but that
   --  caused horrible circular elaboration problems between System.Poll and
   --  Ada.Exceptions. One way of solving such circularities is unification!

   procedure Poll;
   --  Check for asynchronous abort. Note that we do not inline the body.
   --  This makes the interface more useful for debugging purposes.
