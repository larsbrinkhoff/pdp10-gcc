--  This is the Alpha/VMS version of this package.
--
--  This package encapsulates and centralizes information about
--  all uses of interrupts (or signals), including the
--  target-dependent mapping of interrupts (or signals) to exceptions.

--  PLEASE DO NOT add any with-clauses to this package.
--  This is designed to work for both tasking and non-tasking systems,
--  without pulling in any of the tasking support.

--  PLEASE DO NOT remove the Elaborate_Body pragma from this package.
--  Elaboration of this package should happen early, as most other
--  initializations depend on it.
--  Forcing immediate elaboration of the body also helps to enforce
--  the design assumption that this is a second-level
--  package, just one level above System.OS_Interface, with no
--  cross-dependences.

--  PLEASE DO NOT put any subprogram declarations with arguments of
--  type Interrupt_ID into the visible part of this package.
--  The type Interrupt_ID is used to derive the type in Ada.Interrupts,
--  and adding more operations to that type would be illegal according
--  to the Ada Reference Manual.  (This is the reason why the signals sets
--  below are implemented as visible arrays rather than functions.)

package System.Interrupt_Management is

   type Interrupt_Mask is limited private;

   type Interrupt_ID is new System.OS_Interface.Signal;

   type Interrupt_Set is array (Interrupt_ID) of Boolean;

   --  The following objects serve as constants, but are initialized
   --  in the body to aid portability.  This permits us
   --  to use more portable names for interrupts,
   --  where distinct names may map to the same interrupt ID value.
   --  For example, suppose SIGRARE is a signal that is not defined on
   --  all systems, but is always reserved when it is defined.
   --  If we have the convention that ID zero is not used for any "real"
   --  signals, and SIGRARE = 0 when SIGRARE is not one of the locally
   --  supported signals, we can write
   --     Reserved (SIGRARE) := true;
   --  and the initialization code will be portable.

   Abort_Task_Interrupt : Interrupt_ID;
   --  The interrupt that is used to implement task abortion,
   --  if an interrupt is used for that purpose.
   --  This is one of the reserved interrupts.

   Keep_Unmasked : Interrupt_Set := (others => False);
   --  Keep_Unmasked (I) is true iff the interrupt I is
   --  one that must be kept unmasked at all times,
   --  except (perhaps) for short critical sections.
   --  This includes interrupts that are mapped to exceptions
   --  (see System.Interrupt_Exceptions.Is_Exception), but may also
   --  include interrupts (e.g. timer) that need to be kept unmasked
   --  for other reasons.
   --  Where interrupts are implemented as OS signals, and signal masking
   --  is per-task, the interrupt should be unmasked in ALL TASKS.

   Reserve : Interrupt_Set := (others => False);
   --  Reserve (I) is true iff the interrupt I is one that
   --  cannot be permitted to be attached to a user handler.
   --  The possible reasons are many.  For example,
   --  it may be mapped to an exception, used to implement task abortion,
   --  or used to implement time delays.

   Keep_Masked : Interrupt_Set := (others => False);
   --  Keep_Masked (I) is true iff the interrupt I must always be masked.
   --  Where interrupts are implemented as OS signals, and signal masking
   --  is per-task, the interrupt should be masked in ALL TASKS.
   --  There might not be any interrupts in this class, depending on
   --  the environment.  For example, if interrupts are OS signals
   --  and signal masking is per-task, use of the sigwait operation
   --  requires the signal be masked in all tasks.

   procedure Initialize_Interrupts;
   --  On systems where there is no signal inheritance between tasks (e.g
   --  VxWorks, GNU/LinuxThreads), this procedure is used to initialize
   --  interrupts handling in each task. Otherwise this function should
   --  only be called by initialize in this package body.
