-----------------------------
-- Use of These Functions  --
-----------------------------

--  Calling complicated functions from the debugger is generally pretty
--  risky, especially in a multithreaded program.

--  The debugger may interrupt something that is not an Ada task,
--  within the thread implementation, and which is not async-safe.

--  For example, under Solaris, it can interrupt code in "_dynamiclwps",
--  which seems to serve as dispatcher when all the user threads are
--  suspended. By experience, we have found that one cannot safely
--  do certain things, apparently including calls to thread primitives
--  from the debugger if the debugger has interrupted at one of these
--  unsafe points. In general, if you interrupt a running program
--  asynchronously (e.g. via control-C), it will not be safe to
--  call the subprograms in this package.

-----------------
-- Future work --
-----------------

--  It would be nice to be able to tell whether execution has been
--  interrupted in an Ada task. A heuristic way of checking this would
--  be if we added to the Ada TCB a component that always contains a
--  constant value that is unlikely to occur accidentally in code or
--  data. We could then check this in the debugger-callable subprograms,
--  and simply return an error code if it looks unsafe to proceed.

--  ???
--  Recently we have added such a marker as a local variable of the
--  task-wrapper routine. This allows Self to generate a fake ATCB for
--  non-Ada threads of control. Given this capability, it is probably
--  time to revisit the issue above.

--  DEADLOCK

--  We follow a simple rule here to avoid deadlock:

--  We do not use any locks in functions called by gdb, and we do not
--  traverse linked lists.
--
--  The use of an array (Known_Tasks) has many advantages:

--   - Easy and fast to examine;
--   - No risk of dangling references (to the next element) when traversing
--     the array.
