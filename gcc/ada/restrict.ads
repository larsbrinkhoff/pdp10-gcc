with Rident;

with Uintp;  use Uintp;

package Restrict is

   type Restriction_Id is new Rident.Restriction_Id;
   --  The type Restriction_Id defines the set of restriction identifiers,
   --  which take no parameter (i.e. they are either present or not present).
   --  The actual definition is in the separate package Rident, so that
   --  it can easily be accessed by the binder without dragging in lots of
   --  stuff.

   subtype All_Restrictions is
     Restriction_Id range
       Restriction_Id (Rident.All_Restrictions'First) ..
       Restriction_Id (Rident.All_Restrictions'Last);
   --  All restriction identifiers

   subtype Partition_Restrictions is
     Restriction_Id range
       Restriction_Id (Rident.Partition_Restrictions'First) ..
       Restriction_Id (Rident.Partition_Restrictions'Last);
   --  Range of restriction identifiers that are checked by the binder

   subtype Compilation_Unit_Restrictions is
     Restriction_Id range
       Restriction_Id (Rident.Compilation_Unit_Restrictions'First) ..
       Restriction_Id (Rident.Compilation_Unit_Restrictions'Last);
   --  Range of restriction identifiers not checked by binder

   type Restriction_Parameter_Id is new Rident.Restriction_Parameter_Id;
   --  The type Restriction_Parameter_Id records cases where a parameter is
   --  present in the corresponding pragma. These cases are not checked for
   --  consistency by the binder. The actual definition is in the separate
   --  package Rident for consistency.

   type Restrictions_Flags is array (Restriction_Id) of Boolean;
   --  Type used for arrays indexed by Restriction_Id.

   Restrictions : Restrictions_Flags := (others => False);
   --  Corresponding entry is False if restriction is not active, and
   --  True if the restriction is active, i.e. if a pragma Restrictions
   --  has been seen anywhere. Note that we are happy to pick up any
   --  restrictions pragmas in with'ed units, since we are required to
   --  be consistent at link time, and we might as well find the error
   --  at compile time. Clients must NOT use this array for checking to
   --  see if a restriction is violated, instead it is required that the
   --  Check_Restriction subprograms be used for this purpose. The only
   --  legitimate direct use of this array is when the code is modified
   --  as a result of the restriction in some way.

   Restrictions_Loc : array (Restriction_Id) of Source_Ptr;

   --  This variable saves the cumulative restrictions in effect compiling
   --  any unit that is part of the extended main unit (i.e. the compiled
   --  unit, its spec if any, and its subunits if any). The reason we keep
   --  track of this is for the information that goes to the binder about
   --  restrictions that are set. The binder will identify a unit that has
   --  a restrictions pragma for error message purposes, and we do not want
   --  to pick up a restrictions pragma in a with'ed unit for this purpose.

   Violations : Restrictions_Flags := (others => False);
   --  Corresponding entry is False if the restriction has not been
   --  violated in the current main unit, and True if it has been violated.

   Restriction_Parameters :
     array (Restriction_Parameter_Id) of Uint := (others => No_Uint);
   --  This array indicates the setting of restriction parameter identifier
   --  values. All values are initially set to No_Uint indicating that the
   --  parameter is not set, and are set to the appropriate non-negative
   --  value if a Restrictions pragma specifies the corresponding
   --  restriction parameter identifier with an appropriate value.

   Restriction_Parameters_Loc :
     array (Restriction_Parameter_Id) of Source_Ptr;
   --  Locations of Restrictions pragmas for error message purposes.
   --  Valid only if corresponding entry in Restriction_Parameters is
   --  set to a value other than No_Uint.

   --  If a restriction exists post error message at the given node.

   procedure Check_Restriction (R : Restriction_Id; N : Node_Id);
   --  Checks that the given restriction is not set, and if it is set, an
   --  appropriate message is posted on the given node. Also records the
   --  violation in the violations array. Note that it is mandatory to

   --  checks must never be done directly by the caller, since otherwise
   --  they are not properly recorded in the violations array.

   procedure Check_Restriction
     (R : Restriction_Parameter_Id;
      N : Node_Id);
   --  Checks that the given restriction parameter identifier is not set to
   --  zero. If it is set to zero, then the node N is replaced by a node
