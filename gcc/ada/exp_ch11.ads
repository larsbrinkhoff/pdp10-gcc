   --  See runtime routine Ada.Exceptions for full details on the format and
   --  content of these tables.

   procedure Initialize;
   --  Initializes these data structures for a new main unit file

   procedure Expand_At_End_Handler (HSS : Node_Id; Block : Node_Id);
   --  Given a handled statement sequence, HSS, for which the At_End_Proc
   --  field is set, and which currently has no exception handlers, this
   --  procedure expands the special exception handler required.
   --  This procedure also create a new scope for the given Block, if
   --  Block is not Empty.

   procedure Expand_Exception_Handlers (HSS : Node_Id);
   --  This procedure expands exception handlers, and is called as part
   --  of the processing for Expand_N_Handled_Sequence_Of_Statements and
   --  is also called from Expand_At_End_Handler. N is the handled sequence
   --  of statements that has the exception handler(s) to be expanded. This
   --  is also called to expand the special exception handler built for
   --  accept bodies (see Exp_Ch9.Build_Accept_Body).

   --  Procedure called by main driver to generate unit exception table if
   --  zero cost exceptions are enabled. See System.Exceptions for details.

   function Is_Non_Ada_Error (E : Entity_Id) return Boolean;
   --  This function is provided for Gigi use. It returns True if operating on

   --  This is used to generate the special matching code for this exception.

   procedure Remove_Handler_Entries (N : Node_Id);
   --  This procedure is called when optimization circuits determine that
   --  an entire subtree can be removed. If the subtree contains handler
   --  entries in zero cost exception mode, then such removal can lead to
   --  dangling references to non-existent handlers in the handler table.
   --  This procedure removes such references.

   -- Subprogram_Descriptor Generation --
   --------------------------------------

   --  Subprogram descriptors are required for all subprograms, including
   --  explicit subprograms defined in the program, subprograms that are
   --  imported via pragma Import, and also for the implicit elaboration
   --  subprograms used to elaborate package specs and bodies.

   procedure Generate_Subprogram_Descriptor_For_Package
     (N    : Node_Id;
      Spec : Entity_Id);
   --  This is used to create a descriptor for the implicit elaboration
   --  procedure for a package spec of body. The compiler only generates
   --  such descriptors if the package spec or body contains exception
   --  handlers (either explicitly in the case of a body, or from generic
   --  package instantiations). N is the node for the package body or
   --  spec, and Spec is the package body or package entity respectively.
   --  N must be a compilation unit, and the descriptor is placed at
   --  the end of the actions for the auxiliary compilation unit node.

   procedure Generate_Subprogram_Descriptor_For_Subprogram
     (N    : Node_Id;
      Spec : Entity_Id);
   --  This is used to create a desriptor for a subprogram, both those
   --  present in the source, and those implicitly generated by code
   --  expansion. N is the subprogram body node, and Spec is the entity
   --  for the subprogram. The descriptor is placed at the end of the
   --  Last exception handler, or, if there are no handlers, at the end
   --  of the statement sequence.

   procedure Generate_Subprogram_Descriptor_For_Imported_Subprogram
     (Spec  : Entity_Id;
      Slist : List_Id);
   --  This is used to create a descriptor for an imported subprogram.
   --  Such descriptors are needed for propagation of exceptions through
   --  such subprograms. The descriptor never references any handlers,
   --  and is appended to the given Slist.
