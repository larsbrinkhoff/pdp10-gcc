--   type RTS_Lock is limited private;

   --  The difference between Lock and the RTS_Lock is that the later
   --  one serves only as a semaphore so that do not check for
   --  ceiling violations.

   type Task_Body_Access is access procedure;
   --  Pointer to the task body's entry point (or possibly a wrapper
   --  declared local to the GNARL).

--   type Private_Data is limited private;
   --  Any information that the GNULLI needs maintained on a per-task
   --  basis.  A component of this type is guaranteed to be included
   --  in the Ada_Task_Control_Block.
