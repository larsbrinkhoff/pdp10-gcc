--  This is the default version of this package

--  This is a Sun OS (FSU THREADS) version of this package

--  PLEASE DO NOT add any dependences on other packages. ??? why not ???
--  This package is designed to work with or without tasking support.

--  See the other warnings in the package specification before making
--  any modifications to this file.

--  Make a careful study of all signals available under the OS, to see which
--  need to be reserved, kept always unmasked, or kept always unmasked. Be on
--  the lookout for special signals that may be used by the thread library.

--  Since this is a multi target file, the signal <-> exception mapping
--  is simple minded. If you need a more precise and target specific
--  signal handling, create a new s-intman.adb that will fit your needs.

--  This file assumes that:
--
--    SIGFPE, SIGILL, SIGSEGV and SIGBUS exist. They are mapped as follows:
--      SIGPFE  => Constraint_Error
--      SIGILL  => Program_Error
--      SIGSEGV => Storage_Error
--      SIGBUS  => Storage_Error
--
--    SIGINT exists and will be kept unmasked unless the pragma
--     Unreserve_All_Interrupts is specified anywhere in the application.
--
--    System.OS_Interface contains the following:
--      SIGADAABORT: the signal that will be used to abort tasks.
--      Unmasked: the OS specific set of signals that should be unmasked in
--                all the threads. SIGADAABORT is unmasked by
--                default
--      Reserved: the OS specific set of signals that are reserved.
