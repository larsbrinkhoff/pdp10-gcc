--  This is a Solaris Sparc (native) version of this package.

--  used for Asm

separate (System.Task_Primitives.Operations)

----------
-- Self --
----------

--  For Solaris version of RTS, we use a short cut to get the self
--  information faster:

--  We have noticed that on Sparc Solaris, the register g7 always
--  contains the address near the frame pointer (fp) of the active
--  thread (fixed offset). This means, if we declare a variable near
--  the top of the stack for each threads (in our case in the task wrapper)
--  and let the variable hold the Task_ID information, we can get the
--  value without going through the thr_getspecific kernel call.
--
--  There are two things to take care in this trick.
--
--  1) We need to calculate the offset between the g7 value and the
--     local variable address.
--     Possible Solutions :
--        a) Use gdb to figure out the offset.
--        b) Figure it out during the elaboration of RTS by, say,
--           creating a dummy task.
--     We used solution a) mainly because it is more efficient and keeps
--     the RTS from being cluttered with stuff that we won't be used
--     for all environments (i.e., we would have to at least introduce
--     new interfaces).
--
--     On Sparc Solaris the offset was #10#108# (= #16#6b#) with gcc 2.7.2.
--     With gcc 2.8.0, the offset is #10#116# (= #16#74#).
--
--  2) We can not use the same offset business for the main thread
--     because we do not use a wrapper for the main thread.
--     Previousely, we used the difference between g7 and fp to determine
--     wether a task was the main task or not. But this was obviousely
--     wrong since it worked only for tasks that use small amount of
--     stack.
--     So, we now take advantage of the code that recognizes foreign
--     threads (see below) for the main task.
--
--  NOTE: What we are doing here is ABSOLUTELY for Solaris 2.4, 2.5 and 2.6
--        on Sun.

--        We need to make sure this is OK when we move to other versions
--        of the same OS.

--        We always can go back to the old way of doing this and we include
--        the code which use thr_getspecifics. Also, look for %%%%%
--        in comments for other necessary modifications.

--        This code happens to work with Solaris 2.5.1 too, but with gcc
--        2.8.0, this offset is different.

--        ??? Try to rethink the approach here to get a more flexible
--        solution at run time ?

--        One other solution (close to 1-b) would be to add some scanning
--        routine in Enter_Task to compute the offset since now we have
--        a magic number at the beginning of the task code.

--  function Self return Task_ID is
--     Temp   : aliased System.Address;
--     Result : Interfaces.C.int;
--
--  begin
--     Result := thr_getspecific (ATCB_Key, Temp'Unchecked_Access);
--     pragma Assert (Result = 0);
--     return To_Task_ID (Temp);
--  end Self;

--  To make Ada tasks and C threads interoperate better, we have
--  added some functionality to Self.  Suppose a C main program
--  (with threads) calls an Ada procedure and the Ada procedure
--  calls the tasking run-time system.  Eventually, a call will be
--  made to self.  Since the call is not coming from an Ada task,
--  there will be no corresponding ATCB.

--  (The entire Ada run-time system may not have been elaborated,
--  either, but that is a different problem, that we will need to
--  solve another way.)

--  What we do in Self is to catch references that do not come
--  from recognized Ada tasks, and create an ATCB for the calling
--  thread.

--  The new ATCB will be "detached" from the normal Ada task
--  master hierarchy, much like the existing implicitly created
--  signal-server tasks.

--  We will also use such points to poll for disappearance of the
--  threads associated with any implicit ATCBs that we created
--  earlier, and take the opportunity to recover them.

--  A nasty problem here is the limitations of the compilation
--  order dependency, and in particular the GNARL/GNULLI layering.
--  To initialize an ATCB we need to assume System.Tasking has
--  been elaborated.

function Self return Task_ID is
   ATCB_Magic_Code : constant := 16#ADAADAAD#;
   --  This is used to allow us to catch attempts to call Self
   --  from outside an Ada task, with high probability.
   --  For an Ada task, Task_Wrapper.Magic_Number = ATCB_Magic_Code.
