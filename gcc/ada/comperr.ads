--  This package contains the routine called when a fatal internal compiler
--  error is detected. Calls to this routines cause termination of the
--  current compilation with appropriate error output.

package Comperr is

   procedure Compiler_Abort
     (X    : String;
      Code : Integer := 0);
   --  Signals an internal compiler error. Never returns control. Depending
   --  on processing may end up raising Unrecoverable_Error, or exiting
   --  directly. The message output is a "bug box" containing the
   --  string passed as an argument. The node in Current_Error_Node is used
   --  to provide the location where the error should be signalled. The
   --  message includes the node id, and the code parameter if it is positive.
   --  Note that this is only used at the outer level (to handle constraint
   --  errors or assert errors etc.) In the normal logic of the compiler we
   --  always use pragma Assert to check for errors, and if necessary an
   --  explicit abort is achieved by pragma Assert (False). Code is positive
   --  for a gigi abort (giving the gigi abort code), zero for a front
   --  end exception (with possible message stored in TSD.Current_Excep,
   --  and negative (an unused value) for a GCC abort.

   ------------------------------
   -- Use of gnat_bug.box File --
   ------------------------------

   --  When comperr generates the "bug box". The first two lines contain
   --  information on the version number, type of abort, and source location.

   --  Normally the remaining text is one of the following two forms
   --  depending on the version number (p identifies public versions):

   --    Please submit bug report by email to report@gnat.com.
   --    Use a subject line meaningful to you and us to track the bug.
   --    (include your customer number #nnn in the subject line).
   --    Include the entire contents of this bug box in the report.
   --    Include the exact gcc or gnatmake command that you entered.
   --    Also include sources listed below in gnatchop format
   --    (concatenated together with no headers between files).
   --    (use plain ASCII or MIME attachment,
   --    or FTP to your customer directory).
   --    See README.GNATPRO for full info on procedure for submitting bugs.

   --  or (public version case)

   --    Please submit bug report by email to report@gnat.com.
   --    Use a subject line meaningful to you and us to track the bug.
   --    (include your customer number #nnn in the subject line).
   --    Include the entire contents of this bug box in the report.
   --    Include the exact gcc or gnatmake command that you entered.
   --    Also include sources listed below in gnatchop format
   --    (concatenated together with no headers between files).
   --    See gnatinfo.txt for full info on procedure for submitting bugs.

   --  However, an alternative mechanism exists for easily substituting
   --  different text for this message. Compiler_Abort checks for the
   --  existence of the file "gnat_bug.box" in the current source path.
   --  Most typically this file, if present, will be in the directory
   --  containing the run-time sources.

   --  If this file is present, then it is a plain ASCII file, whose
   --  contents replace the above quoted paragraphs. The lines in this
   --  file should be 72 characters or less to avoid misformatting the
   --  right boundary of the box. Note that the file does not contain
   --  the vertical bar characters or any leading spaces in lines.
