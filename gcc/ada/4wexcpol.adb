--  This version is for targets that do not support per-thread asynchronous
--  signals. On such targets, we require compilation with the -gnatP switch
--  that activates periodic polling. Then in the body of the polling routine
--  we test for asynchronous abort.

--  NT, OS/2, HPUX/DCE and SCO currently use this file

with System.Soft_Links;
--  used for Check_Abort_Status

separate (Ada.Exceptions)

   --  Test for asynchronous abort on each poll

   if System.Soft_Links.Check_Abort_Status.all /= 0 then
