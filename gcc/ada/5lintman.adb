--  This is the GNU/Linux version of this package

--  This file performs the system-dependent translation between machine
--  exceptions and the Ada exceptions, if any, that should be raised when they
--  occur. This version works for the x86 running linux.

--  This is a Sun OS (FSU THREADS) version of this package

--  PLEASE DO NOT add any dependences on other packages. ??? why not ???
--  This package is designed to work with or without tasking support.

--  Make a careful study of all signals available under the OS, to see which
--  need to be reserved, kept always unmasked, or kept always unmasked. Be on
--  the lookout for special signals that may be used by the thread library.

--  The definitions of "reserved" differ slightly between the ARM and POSIX.
--  Here is the ARM definition of reserved interrupt:

--  The set of reserved interrupts is implementation defined. A reserved
--  interrupt is either an interrupt for which user-defined handlers are not
--  supported, or one which already has an attached handler by some other
--  implementation-defined means. Program units can be connected to
--  non-reserved interrupts.

--  POSIX.5b/.5c specifies further:

--  Signals which the application cannot accept, and for which the application
--  cannot modify the signal action or masking, because the signals are
--  reserved for use by the Ada language implementation. The reserved signals
--  defined by this standard are Signal_Abort, Signal_Alarm,
--  Signal_Floating_Point_Error, Signal_Illegal_Instruction,
--  Signal_Segmentation_Violation, Signal_Bus_Error. If the implementation
--  supports any signals besides those defined by this standard, the
--  implementation may also reserve some of those.

--  The signals defined by POSIX.5b/.5c that are not specified as being
--  reserved are SIGHUP, SIGINT, SIGPIPE, SIGQUIT, SIGTERM, SIGUSR1, SIGUSR2,
--  SIGCHLD, SIGCONT, SIGSTOP, SIGTSTP, SIGTTIN, SIGTTOU, SIGIO SIGURG, and all
--  the real-time signals.

--  Beware of reserving signals that POSIX.5b/.5c require to be available for
--  users. POSIX.5b/.5c say:

--  An implementation shall not impose restrictions on the ability of an
--  application to send, accept, block, or ignore the signals defined by this
--  standard, except as specified in this standard.

--  Here are some other relevant requirements from POSIX.5b/.5c:

--  For the environment task, the initial signal mask is that specified for
--  the process...

--  It is anticipated that the paragraph above may be modified by a future
--  revision of this standard, to require that the realtime signals always be
--  initially masked for a process that is an Ada active partition.

--  For all other tasks, the initial signal mask shall include all the signals
--  that are not reserved signals and are not bound to entries of the task.
