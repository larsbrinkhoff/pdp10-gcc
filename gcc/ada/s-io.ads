--  A simple text I/O package, used for diagnostic output in the runtime,
--  This package is also preelaborated, unlike Text_Io, and can thus be
--  with'ed by preelaborated library units. It includes only Put routines
--  for character, integer, string and a new line function

package System.IO is
pragma Preelaborate (IO);

   procedure Put (X : Integer);

   procedure Put (C : Character);

   procedure Put (S : String);
   procedure Put_Line (S : String);

   procedure New_Line (Spacing : Positive := 1);

end System.IO;
