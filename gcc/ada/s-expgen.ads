--  This package contains the generic functions which are instantiated with

--  functions called by expanded code generated by Expand_Op_Expon. This
--  version of the package contains routines that are compiled with overflow
--  checks enabled, so they are called for exponentiation operations which
--  require overflow checking

package System.Exp_Gen is
