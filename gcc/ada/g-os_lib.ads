--  Operating system interface facilities

--  This package contains types and procedures for interfacing to the
--  underlying OS. It is used by the GNAT compiler and by tools associated
--  with the GNAT compiler, and therefore works for the various operating
--  systems to which GNAT has been ported. This package will undoubtedly
--  grow as new services are needed by various tools.

--  This package tends to use fairly low-level Ada in order to not bring
--  in large portions of the RTL. For example, functions return access
--  to string as part of avoiding functions returning unconstrained types.

--  Except where specifically noted, these routines are portable across
--  all GNAT implementations on all supported operating systems.

with System;
with Unchecked_Deallocation;

package GNAT.OS_Lib is
pragma Elaborate_Body (OS_Lib);

   type String_Access is access all String;
   --  General purpose string access type. Some of the functions in this
   --  package allocate string results on the heap, and return a value of
   --  this type. Note that the caller is responsible for freeing this
   --  String to avoid memory leaks.

   procedure Free is new Unchecked_Deallocation
     (Object => String, Name => String_Access);
   --  This procedure is provided for freeing returned values of type
   --  String_Access

   type String_List is array (Positive range <>) of String_Access;
   type String_List_Access is access all String_List;
   --  General purpose array and pointer for list of string accesses

   procedure Free (Arg : in out String_List_Access);
   --  Frees the given array and all strings that its elements reference,
   --  and then sets the argument to null. Provided for freeing returned
   --  values of this type (including Argument_List_Access).

   ---------------------
   -- Time/Date Stuff --
   ---------------------

   --  The OS's notion of time is represented by the private type OS_Time.
   --  This is the type returned by the File_Time_Stamp functions to obtain
   --  the time stamp of a specified file. Functions and a procedure (modeled
   --  after the similar subprograms in package Calendar) are provided for
   --  extracting information from a value of this type. Although these are
   --  called GM, the intention is not that they provide GMT times in all
   --  cases but rather the actual (time-zone independent) time stamp of the
   --  file (of course in Unix systems, this *is* in GMT form).

   type OS_Time is private;

   -- File Stuff --
   ----------------

   --  These routines give access to the open/creat/close/read/write level
   --  of I/O routines in the typical C library (these functions are not
   --  part of the ANSI C standard, but are typically available in all
   --  systems). See also package Interfaces.C_Streams for access to the
   --  stream level routines.

   --  Note on file names. If a file name is passed as type String in any
   --  of the following specifications, then the name is a normal Ada string
   --  and need not be NUL-terminated. However, a trailing NUL character is
   --  permitted, and will be ignored (more accurately, the NUL and any
   --  characters that follow it will be ignored).

   --  Corresponds to the int file handle values used in the C routines,

   Standin  : constant File_Descriptor;

   Standerr : constant File_Descriptor;
   --  File descriptors for standard input output files

   Invalid_FD : constant File_Descriptor;
   --  File descriptor returned when error in opening/creating file;

   type Mode is (Binary, Text);
   for Mode'Size use Integer'Size;
   for Mode use (Binary => 0, Text => 1);
   --  Used in all the Open and Create calls to specify if the file is to be
   --  opened in binary mode or text mode. In systems like Unix, this has no
   --  effect, but in systems capable of text mode translation, the use of
   --  Text as the mode parameter causes the system to do CR/LF translation
   --  and also to recognize the DOS end of file character on input. The use
   --  of Text where appropriate allows programs to take a portable Unix view
   --  of DOs-format files and process them appropriately.

   subtype Argument_List is String_List;

   --  Type used to return Argument_List without dragging in secondary stack.
   --  Note that there is a Free procedure declared for this subtype which
   --  frees the array and all referenced strings.

   procedure Normalize_Arguments (Args : in out Argument_List);
   --  Normalize all arguments in the list. This ensure that the argument list
   --  is compatible with the running OS and will works fine with Spawn and
   --  Non_Blocking_Spawn for example. If Normalize_Arguments is called twice
   --  on the same list it will do nothing the second time. Note that Spawn
   --  and Non_Blocking_Spawn call Normalize_Arguments automatically, but
   --  since there is a guarantee that a second call does nothing, this
   --  internal call with have no effect if Normalize_Arguments is called
   --  before calling Spawn. The call to Normalize_Arguments assumes that
   --  the individual referenced arguments in Argument_List are on the heap,
   --  and may free them and reallocate if they are modified.

   procedure Spawn
     (Program_Name : String;
      Args         : Argument_List;
      Success      : out Boolean);
   --  The first parameter of function Spawn is the name of the executable.
   --  The second parameter contains the arguments to be passed to the
   --  program. Success is False if the named program could not be spawned
   --  or its execution completed unsuccessfully. Note that the caller will
   --  be blocked until the execution of the spawned program is complete.
   --  For maximum portability, use a full path name for the Program_Name
   --  argument. On some systems (notably Unix systems) a simple file
   --  name may also work (if the executable can be located in the path).
   --
   --  Note: Arguments in Args that contain spaces and/or quotes such as
   --  "--GCC=gcc -v" or "--GCC=""gcc -v""" are not portable across all
   --  operating systems, and would not have the desired effect if they
   --  were passed directly to the operating system. To avoid this problem,
   --  Spawn makes an internal call to Normalize_Arguments, which ensures
   --  that such arguments are modified in a manner that ensures that the
   --  desired effect is obtained on all operating systems. The caller may
   --  call Normalize_Arguments explicitly before the call (e.g. to print
   --  out the exact form of arguments passed to the operating system). In
   --  this case the guarantee a second call to Normalize_Arguments has no
   --  effect ensures that the internal call will not affect the result.
   --  Note that the implicit call to Normalize_Arguments may free and
   --  reallocate some of the individual arguments.
