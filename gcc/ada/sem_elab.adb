   --  function can only do a fully correct job if in generating code mode
   --  where all bodies have to be present. If we are operating in semantics
   --  check only mode, then in some cases of optional bodies, a result of
   --  False may incorrectly be given. In practice this simply means that
   --  some cases of warnings for incorrect order of elaboration will only
   --  be given when generating code, which is not a big problem (and is

   --  returned unchanged. If it is a body entity, then the spec for
   --  the corresponding spec is returned

   procedure Supply_Bodies (N : Node_Id);
   --  Given a node, N, that is either a subprogram declaration or a package
   --  declaration, this procedure supplies dummy bodies for the subprogram
   --  or for all subprograms in the package. If the given node is not one
   --  of these two possibilities, then Supply_Bodies does nothing. The

   procedure Supply_Bodies (L : List_Id);
   --  Calls Supply_Bodies for all elements of the given list L.

   function Within (E1, E2 : Entity_Id) return Boolean;
   --  Given two scopes E1 and E2, returns True if E1 is equal to E2, or
   --  is one of its contained scopes, False otherwise.

   function Within_Elaborate_All (E : Entity_Id) return Boolean;
   --  Before emitting a warning on a scope E for a missing elaborate_all,
