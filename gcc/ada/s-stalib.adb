--  The purpose of this body is simply to ensure that the two with'ed units
--  are properly included in the link. They are not with'ed from the spec
--  of System.Standard_Library, since this would cause order of elaboration
--  problems (Elaborate_Body would have the same problem).

pragma Warnings (Off);
--  Kill warnings from unused withs

pragma Polling (Off);
--  We must turn polling off for this unit, because otherwise we get
--  elaboration circularities with Ada.Exceptions if polling is on.

with System.Soft_Links;
--  Referenced directly from generated code using external symbols so it
--  must always be present in a build, even if no unit has a direct with
--  of this unit. Also referenced from exception handling routines.
--  This is needed for programs that don't use exceptions explicitly but
--  direct calls to Ada.Exceptions are generated by gigi (for example,
--  by calling __gnat_raise_constraint_error directly).

with System.Memory;
--  Referenced directly from generated code using external symbols, so it
--  must always be present in a build, even if no unit has a direct with
--  of this unit.
