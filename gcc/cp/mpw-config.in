# Configuration fragment for G++.
# Most of the real configuration work happens in the main GCC configure.

# We need to join some lines in the Makefile.in before the sed
# process will work properly.  The funky little sed script works by
# recognizing lines with a trailing '$@ \', adding the next line to
# its "pattern space", editing out the backslash and line, then
# putting the result out.

sed -e '/$@ \\/{N;s/$@ \\./$@ /;P;D;}' \Option-d
