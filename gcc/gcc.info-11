Configurations Supported by GNU CC
==================================

   Here are the possible CPU types:

     1750a, a29k, alpha, arm, avr, cN, clipper, dsp16xx, elxsi, fr30,
     h8300, hppa1.0, hppa1.1, i370, i386, i486, i586, i686, i786, i860,
     i960, m32r, m68000, m68k, m6811, m6812, m88k, mcore, mips, mipsel,
     mips64, mips64el, mn10200, mn10300, ns32k, pdp10, pdp11, powerpc,
     powerpcle, romp, rs6000, sh, sparc, sparclite, sparc64, v850, vax,
     we32k.

   Here are the recognized company names.  As you can see, customary
abbreviations are used rather than the longer official names.

     acorn, alliant, altos, apollo, apple, att, bull, cbm, convergent,
     convex, crds, dec, dg, dolphin, elxsi, encore, harris, hitachi,
     hp, ibm, intergraph, isi, mips, motorola, ncr, next, ns, omron,
     plexus, sequent, sgi, sony, sun, tti, unicom, wrs, xkl.

   The company name is meaningful only to disambiguate when the rest of
the information supplied is insufficient.  You can omit it, writing
just `CPU-SYSTEM', if it is not needed.  For example, `vax-ultrix4.2'
is equivalent to `vax-dec-ultrix4.2'.

   Here is a list of system types:

     386bsd, aix, acis, amigaos, aos, aout, aux, bosx, bsd, clix, coff,
     ctix, cxux, dgux, dynix, ebmon, ecoff, elf, esix, freebsd, hms,
     genix, gnu, linux, linux-gnu, hiux, hpux, iris, irix, isc, luna,
     lynxos, mach, minix, msdos, mvs, netbsd, newsos, nindy, ns, osf,
     osfrose, ptx, riscix, riscos, rtu, sco, sim, solaris, sunos, sym,
     sysv, tops20, udi, ultrix, unicos, uniplus, unos, vms, vsta,
     vxworks, winnt, xenix.

You can omit the system type; then `configure' guesses the operating
system from the CPU and company.

   You can add a version number to the system type; this may or may not
make a difference.  For example, you can write `bsd4.3' or `bsd4.4' to
distinguish versions of BSD.  In practice, the version number is most
needed for `sysv3' and `sysv4', which are often treated differently.

   `linux-gnu' is the canonical name for the GNU/Linux target; however
GNU CC will also accept `linux'.  The version of the kernel in use is
not relevant on these systems.  A suffix such as `libc1' or `aout'
distinguishes major versions of the C library; all of the suffixed
versions are obsolete.

   If you specify an impossible combination such as `i860-dg-vms', then
you may get an error message from `configure', or it may ignore part of
the information and do the best it can with the rest.  `configure'
always prints the canonical name for the alternative that it used.  GNU
CC does not support all possible alternatives.

   Often a particular model of machine has a name.  Many machine names
are recognized as aliases for CPU/company combinations.  Thus, the
machine name `sun3', mentioned above, is an alias for `m68k-sun'.
Sometimes we accept a company name as a machine name, when the name is
popularly used for a particular machine.  Here is a table of the known
machine names:

     3300, 3b1, 3bN, 7300, altos3068, altos, apollo68, att-7300,
     balance, convex-cN, crds, decstation-3100, decstation, delta,
     encore, fx2800, gmicro, hp7NN, hp8NN, hp9k2NN, hp9k3NN, hp9k7NN,
     hp9k8NN, iris4d, iris, isi68, m3230, magnum, merlin, miniframe,
     mmax, news-3600, news800, news, next, pbd, pc532, pmax, powerpc,
     powerpcle, ps2, risc-news, rtpc, sun2, sun386i, sun386, sun3,
     sun4, symmetry, tower-32, tower.

Remember that a machine name specifies both the cpu type and the company
name.  If you want to install your own homemade configuration files,
you can use `local' as the company name to access them.  If you use
configuration `CPU-local', the configuration name without the cpu prefix
is used to form the configuration file names.

   Thus, if you specify `m68k-local', configuration uses files
`m68k.md', `local.h', `m68k.c', `xm-local.h', `t-local', and `x-local',
all in the directory `config/m68k'.

   Here is a list of configurations that have special treatment or
special things you must know:

`1750a-*-*'
     MIL-STD-1750A processors.

     The MIL-STD-1750A cross configuration produces output for
     `as1750', an assembler/linker available under the GNU Public
     License for the 1750A. `as1750' can be obtained at
     `ftp://ftp.fta-berlin.de/pub/crossgcc/1750gals/'.  A similarly
     licensed simulator for the 1750A is available from same address.

     You should ignore a fatal error during the building of libgcc
     (libgcc is not yet implemented for the 1750A.)

     The `as1750' assembler requires the file `ms1750.inc', which is
     found in the directory `config/1750a'.

     GNU CC produced the same sections as the Fairchild F9450 C
     Compiler, namely:

    `Normal'
          The program code section.

    `Static'
          The read/write (RAM) data section.

    `Konst'
          The read-only (ROM) constants section.

    `Init'
          Initialization section (code to copy KREL to SREL).

     The smallest addressable unit is 16 bits (BITS_PER_UNIT is 16).
     This means that type `char' is represented with a 16-bit word per
     character.  The 1750A's "Load/Store Upper/Lower Byte" instructions
     are not used by GNU CC.

`alpha-*-osf1'
     Systems using processors that implement the DEC Alpha architecture
     and are running the DEC Unix (OSF/1) operating system, for example
     the DEC Alpha AXP systems.CC.)

     GNU CC writes a `.verstamp' directive to the assembler output file
     unless it is built as a cross-compiler.  It gets the version to
     use from the system header file `/usr/include/stamp.h'.  If you
     install a new version of DEC Unix, you should rebuild GCC to pick
     up the new version stamp.

     Note that since the Alpha is a 64-bit architecture,
     cross-compilers from 32-bit machines will not generate code as
     efficient as that generated when the compiler is running on a
     64-bit machine because many optimizations that depend on being
     able to represent a word on the target in an integral value on the
     host cannot be performed.  Building cross-compilers on the Alpha
     for 32-bit machines has only been tested in a few cases and may
     not work properly.

     `make compare' may fail on old versions of DEC Unix unless you add
     `-save-temps' to `CFLAGS'.  On these systems, the name of the
     assembler input file is stored in the object file, and that makes
     comparison fail if it differs between the `stage1' and `stage2'
     compilations.  The option `-save-temps' forces a fixed name to be
     used for the assembler input file, instead of a randomly chosen
     name in `/tmp'.  Do not add `-save-temps' unless the comparisons
     fail without that option.  If you add `-save-temps', you will have
     to manually delete the `.i' and `.s' files after each series of
     compilations.

     GNU CC now supports both the native (ECOFF) debugging format used
     by DBX and GDB and an encapsulated STABS format for use only with
     GDB.  See the discussion of the `--with-stabs' option of
     `configure' above for more information on these formats and how to
     select them.

     There is a bug in DEC's assembler that produces incorrect line
     numbers for ECOFF format when the `.align' directive is used.  To
     work around this problem, GNU CC will not emit such alignment
     directives while writing ECOFF format debugging information even
     if optimization is being performed.  Unfortunately, this has the
     very undesirable side-effect that code addresses when `-O' is
     specified are different depending on whether or not `-g' is also
     specified.

     To avoid this behavior, specify `-gstabs+' and use GDB instead of
     DBX.  DEC is now aware of this problem with the assembler and
     hopes to provide a fix shortly.

`arc-*-elf'
     Argonaut ARC processor.  This configuration is intended for
     embedded systems.

`arm-*-aout'
     Advanced RISC Machines ARM-family processors.  These are often
     used in embedded applications.  There are no standard Unix
     configurations.  This configuration corresponds to the basic
     instruction sequences and will produce `a.out' format object
     modules.

     You may need to make a variant of the file `arm.h' for your
     particular configuration.

`arm-*-elf'
     This configuration is intended for embedded systems.

`arm-*-linux*aout'
     Any of the ARM-family processors running the Linux-based GNU
     system with the `a.out' binary format.  This is an obsolete
     configuration.

`arm-*-linux'
`arm-*-linux-gnu'
`arm-*-linux*oldld'
     Any of the ARM-family processors running the Linux-based GNU
     system with the `ELF' binary format.  You must use version
     2.9.1.0.22 or later of the GNU/Linux binutils, which you can
     download from `ftp://ftp.varesearch.com/pub/support/hjl/binutils/'.

     These two configurations differ only in the required version of GNU
     binutils.  For binutils 2.9.1.0.x, use `arm-*-linux-gnuoldld'.  For
     newer versions of binutils, use `arm-*-linux-gnu'.

`arm-*-riscix'
     The ARM2 or ARM3 processor running RISC iX, Acorn's port of BSD
     Unix.  If you are running a version of RISC iX prior to 1.2 then
     you must specify the version number during configuration.  Note
     that the assembler shipped with RISC iX does not support stabs
     debugging information; a new version of the assembler, with stabs
     support included, is now available from Acorn and via ftp
     `ftp://ftp.acorn.com/pub/riscix/as+xterm.tar.Z'.  To enable stabs
     debugging, pass `--with-gnu-as' to configure.

     You will need to install GNU `sed' before you can run configure.

`a29k'
     AMD Am29k-family processors.  These are normally used in embedded
     applications.  There are no standard Unix configurations.  This
     configuration corresponds to AMD's standard calling sequence and
     binary interface and is compatible with other 29k tools.

     You may need to make a variant of the file `a29k.h' for your
     particular configuration.

`a29k-*-bsd'
     AMD Am29050 used in a system running a variant of BSD Unix.

`avr'
     ATMEL AVR-family micro controllers.  These are used in embedded
     applications.  There are no standard Unix configurations.  *Note
     AVR Options::, for the list of supported MCU types.

`decstation-*'
     MIPS-based DECstations can support three different personalities:
     Ultrix, DEC OSF/1, and OSF/rose.  (Alpha-based DECstation products
     have a configuration name beginning with `alpha-dec'.)  To
     configure GCC for these platforms use the following configurations:

    `decstation-ultrix'
          Ultrix configuration.

    `decstation-osf1'
          Dec's version of OSF/1.

    `decstation-osfrose'
          Open Software Foundation reference port of OSF/1 which uses
          the OSF/rose object file format instead of ECOFF.  Normally,
          you would not select this configuration.

     The MIPS C compiler needs to be told to increase its table size
     for switch statements with the `-Wf,-XNg1500' option in order to
     compile `cp/parse.c'.  If you use the `-O2' optimization option,
     you also need to use `-Olimit 3000'.  Both of these options are
     automatically generated in the `Makefile' that the shell script
     `configure' builds.  If you override the `CC' make variable and
     use the MIPS compilers, you may need to add `-Wf,-XNg1500 -Olimit
     3000'.

`elxsi-elxsi-bsd'
     The Elxsi's C compiler has known limitations that prevent it from
     compiling GNU C.  Please contact <mrs@cygnus.com> for more details.

`dsp16xx'
     A port to the AT&T DSP1610 family of processors.

`h8300-*-*'
     Hitachi H8/300 series of processors.

     The calling convention and structure layout has changed in release
     2.6.  All code must be recompiled.  The calling convention now
     passes the first three arguments in function calls in registers.
     Structures are no longer a multiple of 2 bytes.

`i370-*-*'
     This port is very preliminary and has many known bugs.  We hope to
     have a higher-quality port for this machine soon.

`i386-*-linux*oldld'
     Use this configuration to generate `a.out' binaries on Linux-based
     GNU systems if you do not have gas/binutils version 2.5.2 or later
     installed. This is an obsolete configuration.

`i386-*-linux*aout'
     Use this configuration to generate `a.out' binaries on Linux-based
     GNU systems. This configuration is being superseded. You must use
     gas/binutils version 2.5.2 or later.

`i386-*-linux'
`i386-*-linux-gnu'
     Use this configuration to generate ELF binaries on Linux-based GNU
     systems.  You must use gas/binutils version 2.5.2 or later.

`i386-*-sco'
     Compilation with RCC is recommended.  Also, it may be a good idea
     to link with GNU malloc instead of the malloc that comes with the
     system.

`i386-*-sco3.2v4'
     Use this configuration for SCO release 3.2 version 4.

`i386-*-sco3.2v5*'
     Use this for the SCO OpenServer Release 5 family of operating
     systems.

`i386-*-isc'
     It may be a good idea to link with GNU malloc instead of the
     malloc that comes with the system.

     In ISC version 4.1, `sed' core dumps when building `deduced.h'.
     Use the version of `sed' from version 4.0.

`i386-*-esix'
     It may be good idea to link with GNU malloc instead of the malloc
     that comes with the system.

`i386-ibm-aix'
     You need to use GAS version 2.1 or later, and LD from GNU binutils
     version 2.2 or later.

`i386-sequent-bsd'
     Go to the Berkeley universe before compiling.

`i386-sequent-ptx1*'
`i386-sequent-ptx2*'
     You must install GNU `sed' before running `configure'.

`i386-sun-sunos4'
     You may find that you need another version of GNU CC to begin
     bootstrapping with, since the current version when built with the
     system's own compiler seems to get an infinite loop compiling part
     of `libgcc2.c'.  GNU CC version 2 compiled with GNU CC (any
     version) seems not to have this problem.

     See *Note Sun Install::, for information on installing GNU CC on
     Sun systems.

`i860-intel-osf1'
     This is the Paragon.  If you have version 1.0 of the operating
     system, see *Note Installation Problems::, for special things you
     need to do to compensate for peculiarities in the system.

`*-lynx-lynxos'
     LynxOS 2.2 and earlier comes with GNU CC 1.x already installed as
     `/bin/gcc'.  You should compile with this instead of `/bin/cc'.
     You can tell GNU CC to use the GNU assembler and linker, by
     specifying `--with-gnu-as --with-gnu-ld' when configuring.  These
     will produce COFF format object files and executables;  otherwise
     GNU CC will use the installed tools, which produce `a.out' format
     executables.

`m32r-*-elf'
     Mitsubishi M32R processor.  This configuration is intended for
     embedded systems.

`m68000-hp-bsd'
     HP 9000 series 200 running BSD.  Note that the C compiler that
     comes with this system cannot compile GNU CC; contact
     <law@cygnus.com> to get binaries of GNU CC for bootstrapping.

`m68k-altos'
     Altos 3068.  You must use the GNU assembler, linker and debugger.
     Also, you must fix a kernel bug.  Details in the file
     `README.ALTOS'.

`m68k-apple-aux'
     Apple Macintosh running A/UX.  You may configure GCC  to use
     either the system assembler and linker or the GNU assembler and
     linker.  You should use the GNU configuration if you can,
     especially if you also want to use GNU C++.  You enabled that
     configuration with + the `--with-gnu-as' and `--with-gnu-ld'
     options to `configure'.

     Note the C compiler that comes with this system cannot compile GNU
     CC.  You can find binaries of GNU CC for bootstrapping on
     `jagubox.gsfc.nasa.gov'.  You will also a patched version of
     `/bin/ld' there that raises some of the arbitrary limits found in
     the original.

`m68k-att-sysv'
     AT&T 3b1, a.k.a. 7300 PC.  This version of GNU CC cannot be
     compiled with the system C compiler, which is too buggy.  You will
     need to get a previous version of GCC and use it to bootstrap.
     Binaries are available from the OSU-CIS archive, at
     `ftp://archive.cis.ohio-state.edu/pub/att7300/'.

`m68k-bull-sysv'
     Bull DPX/2 series 200 and 300 with BOS-2.00.45 up to BOS-2.01. GNU
     CC works either with native assembler or GNU assembler. You can use
     GNU assembler with native coff generation by providing
     `--with-gnu-as' to the configure script or use GNU assembler with
     dbx-in-coff encapsulation by providing `--with-gnu-as --stabs'.
     For any problem with native assembler or for availability of the
     DPX/2 port of GAS, contact <F.Pierresteguy@frcl.bull.fr>.

`m68k-crds-unox'
     Use `configure unos' for building on Unos.

     The Unos assembler is named `casm' instead of `as'.  For some
     strange reason linking `/bin/as' to `/bin/casm' changes the
     behavior, and does not work.  So, when installing GNU CC, you
     should install the following script as `as' in the subdirectory
     where the passes of GCC are installed:

          #!/bin/sh
          casm $*

     The default Unos library is named `libunos.a' instead of `libc.a'.
     To allow GNU CC to function, either change all references to
     `-lc' in `gcc.c' to `-lunos' or link `/lib/libc.a' to
     `/lib/libunos.a'.

     When compiling GNU CC with the standard compiler, to overcome bugs
     in the support of `alloca', do not use `-O' when making stage 2.
     Then use the stage 2 compiler with `-O' to make the stage 3
     compiler.  This compiler will have the same characteristics as the
     usual stage 2 compiler on other systems.  Use it to make a stage 4
     compiler and compare that with stage 3 to verify proper
     compilation.

     (Perhaps simply defining `ALLOCA' in `x-crds' as described in the
     comments there will make the above paragraph superfluous.  Please
     inform us of whether this works.)

     Unos uses memory segmentation instead of demand paging, so you
     will need a lot of memory.  5 Mb is barely enough if no other
     tasks are running.  If linking `cc1' fails, try putting the object
     files into a library and linking from that library.

`m68k-hp-hpux'
     HP 9000 series 300 or 400 running HP-UX.  HP-UX version 8.0 has a
     bug in the assembler that prevents compilation of GNU CC.  To fix
     it, get patch PHCO_4484 from HP.

     In addition, if you wish to use gas `--with-gnu-as' you must use
     gas version 2.1 or later, and you must use the GNU linker version
     2.1 or later.  Earlier versions of gas relied upon a program which
     converted the gas output into the native HP-UX format, but that
     program has not been kept up to date.  gdb does not understand
     that native HP-UX format, so you must use gas if you wish to use
     gdb.

`m68k-sun'
     Sun 3.  We do not provide a configuration file to use the Sun FPA
     by default, because programs that establish signal handlers for
     floating point traps inherently cannot work with the FPA.

     See *Note Sun Install::, for information on installing GNU CC on
     Sun systems.

`m6811-elf'
     Motorola 68HC11 family micro controllers.  These are used in
     embedded applications.  There are no standard Unix configurations.

`m6812-elf'
     Motorola 68HC12 family micro controllers.  These are used in
     embedded applications.  There are no standard Unix configurations.

`m88k-*-svr3'
     Motorola m88k running the AT&T/Unisoft/Motorola V.3 reference port.
     These systems tend to use the Green Hills C, revision 1.8.5, as the
     standard C compiler.  There are apparently bugs in this compiler
     that result in object files differences between stage 2 and stage
     3.  If this happens, make the stage 4 compiler and compare it to
     the stage 3 compiler.  If the stage 3 and stage 4 object files are
     identical, this suggests you encountered a problem with the
     standard C compiler; the stage 3 and 4 compilers may be usable.

     It is best, however, to use an older version of GNU CC for
     bootstrapping if you have one.

`m88k-*-dgux'
     Motorola m88k running DG/UX.  To build 88open BCS native or cross
     compilers on DG/UX, specify the configuration name as
     `m88k-*-dguxbcs' and build in the 88open BCS software development
     environment.  To build ELF native or cross compilers on DG/UX,
     specify `m88k-*-dgux' and build in the DG/UX ELF development
     environment.  You set the software development environment by
     issuing `sde-target' command and specifying either `m88kbcs' or
     `m88kdguxelf' as the operand.

     If you do not specify a configuration name, `configure' guesses the
     configuration based on the current software development
     environment.

`m88k-tektronix-sysv3'
     Tektronix XD88 running UTekV 3.2e.  Do not turn on optimization
     while building stage1 if you bootstrap with the buggy Green Hills
     compiler.  Also, The bundled LAI System V NFS is buggy so if you
     build in an NFS mounted directory, start from a fresh reboot, or
     avoid NFS all together.  Otherwise you may have trouble getting
     clean comparisons between stages.

`mips-mips-bsd'
     MIPS machines running the MIPS operating system in BSD mode.  It's
     possible that some old versions of the system lack the functions
     `memcpy', `memmove', `memcmp', and `memset'.  If your system lacks
     these, you must remove or undo the definition of
     `TARGET_MEM_FUNCTIONS' in `mips-bsd.h'.

     The MIPS C compiler needs to be told to increase its table size
     for switch statements with the `-Wf,-XNg1500' option in order to
     compile `cp/parse.c'.  If you use the `-O2' optimization option,
     you also need to use `-Olimit 3000'.  Both of these options are
     automatically generated in the `Makefile' that the shell script
     `configure' builds.  If you override the `CC' make variable and
     use the MIPS compilers, you may need to add `-Wf,-XNg1500 -Olimit
     3000'.

     MIPS computers running RISC-OS can support four different
     personalities: default, BSD 4.3, System V.3, and System V.4 (older
     versions of RISC-OS don't support V.4).  To configure GCC for
     these platforms use the following configurations:

    `mips-mips-riscos`rev''
          Default configuration for RISC-OS, revision `rev'.

    `mips-mips-riscos`rev'bsd'
          BSD 4.3 configuration for RISC-OS, revision `rev'.

    `mips-mips-riscos`rev'sysv4'
          System V.4 configuration for RISC-OS, revision `rev'.

    `mips-mips-riscos`rev'sysv'
          System V.3 configuration for RISC-OS, revision `rev'.

     The revision `rev' mentioned above is the revision of RISC-OS to
     use.  You must reconfigure GCC when going from a RISC-OS revision
     4 to RISC-OS revision 5.  This has the effect of avoiding a linker
     bug (see *Note Installation Problems::, for more details).

`mips-sgi-*'
     In order to compile GCC on an SGI running IRIX 4, the "c.hdr.lib"
     option must be installed from the CD-ROM supplied from Silicon
     Graphics.  This is found on the 2nd CD in release 4.0.1.

     In order to compile GCC on an SGI running IRIX 5, the
     "compiler_dev.hdr" subsystem must be installed from the IDO CD-ROM
     supplied by Silicon Graphics.

     `make compare' may fail on version 5 of IRIX unless you add
     `-save-temps' to `CFLAGS'.  On these systems, the name of the
     assembler input file is stored in the object file, and that makes
     comparison fail if it differs between the `stage1' and `stage2'
     compilations.  The option `-save-temps' forces a fixed name to be
     used for the assembler input file, instead of a randomly chosen
     name in `/tmp'.  Do not add `-save-temps' unless the comparisons
     fail without that option.  If you do you `-save-temps', you will
     have to manually delete the `.i' and `.s' files after each series
     of compilations.

     The MIPS C compiler needs to be told to increase its table size
     for switch statements with the `-Wf,-XNg1500' option in order to
     compile `cp/parse.c'.  If you use the `-O2' optimization option,
     you also need to use `-Olimit 3000'.  Both of these options are
     automatically generated in the `Makefile' that the shell script
     `configure' builds.  If you override the `CC' make variable and
     use the MIPS compilers, you may need to add `-Wf,-XNg1500 -Olimit
     3000'.

     On Irix version 4.0.5F, and perhaps on some other versions as well,
     there is an assembler bug that reorders instructions incorrectly.
     To work around it, specify the target configuration
     `mips-sgi-irix4loser'.  This configuration inhibits assembler
     optimization.

     In a compiler configured with target `mips-sgi-irix4', you can turn
     off assembler optimization by using the `-noasmopt' option.  This
     compiler option passes the option `-O0' to the assembler, to
     inhibit reordering.

     The `-noasmopt' option can be useful for testing whether a problem
     is due to erroneous assembler reordering.  Even if a problem does
     not go away with `-noasmopt', it may still be due to assembler
     reordering--perhaps GNU CC itself was miscompiled as a result.

     To enable debugging under Irix 5, you must use GNU as 2.5 or later,
     and use the `--with-gnu-as' configure option when configuring gcc.
     GNU as is distributed as part of the binutils package.

`mips-sony-sysv'
     Sony MIPS NEWS.  This works in NEWSOS 5.0.1, but not in 5.0.2
     (which uses ELF instead of COFF).  Support for 5.0.2 will probably
     be provided soon by volunteers.  In particular, the linker does
     not like the code generated by GCC when shared libraries are
     linked in.

`ns32k-encore'
     Encore ns32000 system.  Encore systems are supported only under
     BSD.

`ns32k-*-genix'
     National Semiconductor ns32000 system.  Genix has bugs in `alloca'
     and `malloc'; you must get the compiled versions of these from GNU
     Emacs.

`ns32k-sequent'
     Go to the Berkeley universe before compiling.

`ns32k-utek'
     UTEK ns32000 system ("merlin").  The C compiler that comes with
     this system cannot compile GNU CC; contact `tektronix!reed!mason'
     to get binaries of GNU CC for bootstrapping.

`pdp10-*-tops20'
     TODO.  -with-cpu=...

`romp-*-aos'
`romp-*-mach'
     The only operating systems supported for the IBM RT PC are AOS and
     MACH.  GNU CC does not support AIX running on the RT.  We
     recommend you compile GNU CC with an earlier version of itself; if
     you compile GNU CC with `hc', the Metaware compiler, it will work,
     but you will get mismatches between the stage 2 and stage 3
     compilers in various files.  These errors are minor differences in
     some floating-point constants and can be safely ignored; the stage
     3 compiler is correct.

`rs6000-*-aix'
`powerpc-*-aix'
     Various early versions of each release of the IBM XLC compiler
     will not bootstrap GNU CC.  Symptoms include differences between
     the stage2 and stage3 object files, and errors when compiling
     `libgcc.a' or `enquire'.  Known problematic releases include:
     xlc-1.2.1.8, xlc-1.3.0.0 (distributed with AIX 3.2.5), and
     xlc-1.3.0.19.  Both xlc-1.2.1.28 and xlc-1.3.0.24 (PTF 432238) are
     known to produce working versions of GNU CC, but most other recent
     releases correctly bootstrap GNU CC.

     Release 4.3.0 of AIX and ones prior to AIX 3.2.4 include a version
     of the IBM assembler which does not accept debugging directives:
     assembler updates are available as PTFs.  Also, if you are using
     AIX 3.2.5 or greater and the GNU assembler, you must have a
     version modified after October 16th, 1995 in order for the GNU C
     compiler to build.  See the file `README.RS6000' for more details
     on any of these problems.

     GNU CC does not yet support the 64-bit PowerPC instructions.

     Objective C does not work on this architecture because it makes
     assumptions that are incompatible with the calling conventions.

     AIX on the RS/6000 provides support (NLS) for environments outside
     of the United States.  Compilers and assemblers use NLS to support
     locale-specific representations of various objects including
     floating-point numbers ("." vs "," for separating decimal
     fractions).  There have been problems reported where the library
     linked with GNU CC does not produce the same floating-point
     formats that the assembler accepts.  If you have this problem, set
     the LANG environment variable to "C" or "En_US".

     Due to changes in the way that GNU CC invokes the binder (linker)
     for AIX 4.1, you may now receive warnings of duplicate symbols
     from the link step that were not reported before.  The assembly
     files generated by GNU CC for AIX have always included multiple
     symbol definitions for certain global variable and function
     declarations in the original program.  The warnings should not
     prevent the linker from producing a correct library or runnable
     executable.

     By default, AIX 4.1 produces code that can be used on either Power
     or PowerPC processors.

     You can specify a default version for the `-mcpu='CPU_TYPE switch
     by using the configure option `--with-cpu-'CPU_TYPE.

     under the PSIM simulator.

     You can specify a default version for the `-mcpu='CPU_TYPE switch

`powerpcle-*-elf'
`powerpcle-*-sysv4'
     PowerPC system in little endian mode, running System V.4.

     You can specify a default version for the `-mcpu='CPU_TYPE switch
     by using the configure option `--with-cpu-'CPU_TYPE.

`powerpcle-*-solaris2*'
     PowerPC system in little endian mode, running Solaris 2.5.1 or
     higher.

     You can specify a default version for the `-mcpu='CPU_TYPE switch
     by using the configure option `--with-cpu-'CPU_TYPE.  Beta
     versions of the Sun 4.0 compiler do not seem to be able to build
     GNU CC correctly.  There are also problems with the host assembler
     and linker that are fixed by using the GNU versions of these tools.

`powerpcle-*-eabisim'
     Embedded PowerPC system in little endian mode for use in running

     PowerPC system in little endian mode running Windows NT.

     You can specify a default version for the `-mcpu='CPU_TYPE switch
     by using the configure option `--with-cpu-'CPU_TYPE.

`vax-dec-ultrix'
     Don't try compiling with Vax C (`vcc').  It produces incorrect code
     in some cases (for example, when `alloca' is used).

     Meanwhile, compiling `cp/parse.c' with pcc does not work because of
     an internal table size limitation in that compiler.  To avoid this
     problem, compile just the GNU C compiler first, and use it to
     recompile building all the languages that you want to run.

`sparc-sun-*'
     See *Note Sun Install::, for information on installing GNU CC on
     Sun systems.

`vax-dec-vms'
     See *Note VMS Install::, for details on how to install GNU CC on
     VMS.

`we32k-*-*'
     These computers are also known as the 3b2, 3b5, 3b20 and other
     similar names.  (However, the 3b1 is actually a 68000; see *Note
     Configurations::.)

     Don't use `-g' when compiling with the system's compiler.  The
     system's linker seems to be unable to handle such a large program
     with debugging information.

     The system's compiler runs out of capacity when compiling `stmt.c'
     in GNU CC.  You can work around this by building `cpp' in GNU CC
     first, then use that instead of the system's preprocessor with the
     system's C compiler to compile `stmt.c'.  Here is how:

          mv /lib/cpp /lib/cpp.att
          cp cpp /lib/cpp.gnu
          echo '/lib/cpp.gnu -traditional ${1+"$@"}' > /lib/cpp
          chmod +x /lib/cpp

     The system's compiler produces bad code for some of the GNU CC
     optimization files.  So you must build the stage 2 compiler without
     optimization.  Then build a stage 3 compiler with optimization.
     That executable should work.  Here are the necessary commands:

          make LANGUAGES=c CC=stage1/xgcc CFLAGS="-Bstage1/ -g"
          make stage2
          make CC=stage2/xgcc CFLAGS="-Bstage2/ -g -O"

     You may need to raise the ULIMIT setting to build a C++ compiler,
     as the file `cc1plus' is larger than one megabyte.

Compilation in a Separate Directory
===================================

   If you wish to build the object files and executables in a directory
other than the one containing the source files, here is what you must
do differently:

  1. Make sure you have a version of Make that supports the `VPATH'
     feature.  (GNU Make supports it, as do Make versions on most BSD
     systems.)

  2. If you have ever run `configure' in the source directory, you must
     undo the configuration.  Do this by running:

          make distclean

  3. Go to the directory in which you want to build the compiler before
     running `configure':

          mkdir gcc-sun3
          cd gcc-sun3

     On systems that do not support symbolic links, this directory must
     be on the same file system as the source code directory.

  4. Specify where to find `configure' when you run it:

          ../gcc/configure ...

     This also tells `configure' where to find the compiler sources;
     `configure' takes the directory from the file name that was used to
     invoke it.  But if you want to be sure, you can specify the source
     directory with the `--srcdir' option, like this:

          ../gcc/configure --srcdir=../gcc OTHER OPTIONS

     The directory you specify with `--srcdir' need not be the same as
     the one that `configure' is found in.

   Now, you can run `make' in that directory.  You need not repeat the
configuration steps shown above, when ordinary source files change.  You
must, however, run `configure' again when the configuration files
change, if your system does not support symbolic links.

Building and Installing a Cross-Compiler
========================================

   GNU CC can function as a cross-compiler for many machines, but not
all.

   * Cross-compilers for the Mips as target using the Mips assembler
     currently do not work, because the auxiliary programs
     `mips-tdump.c' and `mips-tfile.c' can't be compiled on anything
     but a Mips.  It does work to cross compile for a Mips if you use
     the GNU assembler and linker.

   * Cross-compilers between machines with different floating point
     formats have not all been made to work.  GNU CC now has a floating
     point emulator with which these can work, but each target machine
     description needs to be updated to take advantage of it.

   * Cross-compilation between machines of different word sizes is
     somewhat problematic and sometimes does not work.

   Since GNU CC generates assembler code, you probably need a
cross-assembler that GNU CC can run, in order to produce object files.
If you want to link on other than the target machine, you need a
cross-linker as well.  You also need header files and libraries suitable
for the target machine that you can install on the host machine.

Steps of Cross-Compilation
--------------------------

   To compile and run a program using a cross-compiler involves several
steps:

   * Run the cross-compiler on the host machine to produce assembler
     files for the target machine.  This requires header files for the
     target machine.

   * Assemble the files produced by the cross-compiler.  You can do this
     either with an assembler on the target machine, or with a
     cross-assembler on the host machine.

   * Link those files to make an executable.  You can do this either
     with a linker on the target machine, or with a cross-linker on the
     host machine.  Whichever machine you use, you need libraries and
     certain startup files (typically `crt....o') for the target
     machine.

   It is most convenient to do all of these steps on the same host
machine, since then you can do it all with a single invocation of GNU
CC.  This requires a suitable cross-assembler and cross-linker.  For
some targets, the GNU assembler and linker are available.


File: gcc.info,  Node: Configure Cross,  Next: Tools and Libraries,  Prev: Steps of Cross,  Up: Cross-Compiler

Configuring a Cross-Compiler
----------------------------

   To build GNU CC as a cross-compiler, you start out by running
`configure'.  Use the `--target=TARGET' to specify the target type.  If
`configure' was unable to correctly identify the system you are running
on, also specify the `--build=BUILD' option.  For example, here is how
to configure for a cross-compiler that produces code for an HP 68030
system running BSD on a system that `configure' can correctly identify:

     ./configure --target=m68k-hp-bsd4.3


File: gcc.info,  Node: Tools and Libraries,  Next: Cross Headers,  Prev: Configure Cross,  Up: Cross-Compiler

Tools and Libraries for a Cross-Compiler
----------------------------------------

   If you have a cross-assembler and cross-linker available, you should
install them now.  Put them in the directory `/usr/local/TARGET/bin'.
Here is a table of the tools you should put in this directory:

`as'
     This should be the cross-assembler.

`ld'
     This should be the cross-linker.

`ar'
     This should be the cross-archiver: a program which can manipulate
     archive files (linker libraries) in the target machine's format.

`ranlib'
     This should be a program to construct a symbol table in an archive
     file.

   The installation of GNU CC will find these programs in that
directory, and copy or link them to the proper place to for the
cross-compiler to find them when run later.

   The easiest way to provide these files is to build the Binutils
package and GAS.  Configure them with the same `--host' and `--target'
options that you use for configuring GNU CC, then build and install
them.  They install their executables automatically into the proper
directory.  Alas, they do not support all the targets that GNU CC
supports.

   If you want to install libraries to use with the cross-compiler,
such as a standard C library, put them in the directory
`/usr/local/TARGET/lib'; installation of GNU CC copies all the files in
that subdirectory into the proper place for GNU CC to find them and
link with them.  Here's an example of copying some libraries from a
target machine:

     ftp TARGET-MACHINE
     lcd /usr/local/TARGET/lib
     cd /lib
     get libc.a
     cd /usr/lib
     get libg.a
     get libm.a
     quit

The precise set of libraries you'll need, and their locations on the
target machine, vary depending on its operating system.

   Many targets require "start files" such as `crt0.o' and `crtn.o'
which are linked into each executable; these too should be placed in
`/usr/local/TARGET/lib'.  There may be several alternatives for
`crt0.o', for use with profiling or other compilation options.  Check
your target's definition of `STARTFILE_SPEC' to find out what start
files it uses.  Here's an example of copying these files from a target
machine:

     ftp TARGET-MACHINE
     lcd /usr/local/TARGET/lib
     prompt
     cd /lib
     mget *crt*.o
     cd /usr/lib
     mget *crt*.o
     quit


File: gcc.info,  Node: Cross Runtime,  Next: Build Cross,  Prev: Cross Headers,  Up: Cross-Compiler

`libgcc.a' and Cross-Compilers
------------------------------

   Code compiled by GNU CC uses certain runtime support functions
implicitly.  Some of these functions can be compiled successfully with
GNU CC itself, but a few cannot be.  These problem functions are in the
source file `libgcc1.c'; the library made from them is called
`libgcc1.a'.

   When you build a native compiler, these functions are compiled with
some other compiler-the one that you use for bootstrapping GNU CC.
Presumably it knows how to open code these operations, or else knows how
to call the run-time emulation facilities that the machine comes with.
But this approach doesn't work for building a cross-compiler.  The
compiler that you use for building knows about the host system, not the
target system.

   So, when you build a cross-compiler you have to supply a suitable
library `libgcc1.a' that does the job it is expected to do.

   To compile `libgcc1.c' with the cross-compiler itself does not work.
The functions in this file are supposed to implement arithmetic
operations that GNU CC does not know how to open code for your target
machine.  If these functions are compiled with GNU CC itself, they will
compile into infinite recursion.

   On any given target, most of these functions are not needed.  If GNU
CC can open code an arithmetic operation, it will not call these
functions to perform the operation.  It is possible that on your target
machine, none of these functions is needed.  If so, you can supply an
empty library as `libgcc1.a'.

   Many targets need library support only for multiplication and
division.  If you are linking with a library that contains functions for
multiplication and division, you can tell GNU CC to call them directly
by defining the macros `MULSI3_LIBCALL', and the like.  These macros
need to be defined in the target description macro file.  For some
targets, they are defined already.  This may be sufficient to avoid the
need for libgcc1.a; if so, you can supply an empty library.

   Some targets do not have floating point instructions; they need other
functions in `libgcc1.a', which do floating arithmetic.  Recent
versions of GNU CC have a file which emulates floating point.  With a
certain amount of work, you should be able to construct a floating
point emulator that can be used as `libgcc1.a'.  Perhaps future
versions will contain code to do this automatically and conveniently.
That depends on whether someone wants to implement it.

   Some embedded targets come with all the necessary `libgcc1.a'
routines written in C or assembler.  These targets build `libgcc1.a'
automatically and you do not need to do anything special for them.
Other embedded targets do not need any `libgcc1.a' routines since all
the necessary operations are supported by the hardware.

   If your target system has another C compiler, you can configure GNU
CC as a native compiler on that machine, build just `libgcc1.a' with
`make libgcc1.a' on that machine, and use the resulting file with the
cross-compiler.  To do this, execute the following on the target
machine:

     cd TARGET-BUILD-DIR
     ./configure --host=sparc --target=sun3
     make libgcc1.a

And then this on the host machine:

     ftp TARGET-MACHINE
     binary
     cd TARGET-BUILD-DIR
     get libgcc1.a
     quit

   Another way to provide the functions you need in `libgcc1.a' is to
define the appropriate `perform_...' macros for those functions.  If
these definitions do not use the C arithmetic operators that they are
meant to implement, you should be able to compile them with the
cross-compiler you are building.  (If these definitions already exist
for your target file, then you are all set.)

   To build `libgcc1.a' using the perform macros, use
`LIBGCC1=libgcc1.a OLDCC=./xgcc' when building the compiler.
Otherwise, you should place your replacement library under the name
`libgcc1.a' in the directory in which you will build the
cross-compiler, before you run `make'.

Cross-Compilers and Header Files
--------------------------------

   If you are cross-compiling a standalone program or a program for an
embedded system, then you may not need any header files except the few
that are part of GNU CC (and those of your program).  However, if you
intend to link your program with a standard C library such as `libc.a',
then you probably need to compile with the header files that go with
the library you use.

   The GNU C compiler does not come with these files, because (1) they
are system-specific, and (2) they belong in a C library, not in a
compiler.

   If the GNU C library supports your target machine, then you can get
the header files from there (assuming you actually use the GNU library
when you link your program).

   If your target machine comes with a C compiler, it probably comes
with suitable header files also.  If you make these files accessible
from the host machine, the cross-compiler can use them also.

   Otherwise, you're on your own in finding header files to use when
cross-compiling.

   When you have found suitable header files, put them in the directory
`/usr/local/TARGET/include', before building the cross compiler.  Then
installation will run fixincludes properly and install the corrected
versions of the header files where the compiler will use them.

   Provide the header files before you build the cross-compiler, because
the build stage actually runs the cross-compiler to produce parts of
`libgcc.a'.  (These are the parts that _can_ be compiled with GNU CC.)
Some of them need suitable header files.

   Here's an example showing how to copy the header files from a target
machine.  On the target machine, do this:

     (cd /usr/include; tar cf - .) > tarfile

   Then, on the host machine, do this:

     ftp TARGET-MACHINE
     lcd /usr/local/TARGET/include
     get tarfile
     quit
     tar xf tarfile
